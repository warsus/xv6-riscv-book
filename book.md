Foreword and acknowledgments {#foreword-and-acknowledgments .unnumbered}
============================

This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It
explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example
kernel, named xv6. Xv6 is modeled on Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's
Unix Version 6 (v6) [@unix]. Xv6 loosely follows the structure and style
of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C [@kernighan] for a multi-core
RISC-V [@riscv].

This text should be read along with the source code for xv6, an approach
inspired by John Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition [@lions]; the
text has hyperlinks to the source code at
<https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv>. See
<https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810> for additional pointers to on-line
resources for v6 and xv6, including several lab assignments using xv6.

Operating system interfaces {#CH:UNIX}
===========================

The job of an operating system is to share a computer among multiple
programs and to provide a more useful set of services than the hardware
alone supports. An operating system manages and abstracts the low-level
hardware, so that, for example, a word processor need not concern itself
with which type of disk hardware is being used. An operating system
shares the hardware among multiple programs so that they run (or appear
to run) at the same time. Finally, operating systems provide controlled
ways for programs to interact, so that they can share data or work
together.

An operating system provides services to user programs through an
interface. Designing a good interface turns out to be difficult. On the
one hand, we would like the interface to be simple and narrow because
that makes it easier to get the implementation right. On the other hand,
we may be tempted to offer many sophisticated features to applications.
The trick in resolving this tension is to design interfaces that rely on
a few mechanisms that can be combined to provide much generality.

This book uses a single operating system as a concrete example to
illustrate operating system concepts. That operating system, xv6,
provides the basic interfaces introduced by Ken Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie's Unix operating system [@unix], as well as mimicking Unix's
internal design. Unix provides a narrow interface whose mechanisms
combine well, offering a surprising degree of generality. This interface
has been so successful that modern operating systems---BSD, Linux,
macOS, Solaris, and even, to a lesser extent, Microsoft Windows---have
Unix-like interfaces. Understanding xv6 is a good start toward
understanding any of these systems and many others.

As Figure [1.1](#fig:os){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:os"} shows,
xv6 takes the traditional form of a *kernel*, a special program that
provides services to running programs. Each running program, called a
*process*, has memory containing instructions, data, and a stack. The
instructions implement the program's computation. The data are the
variables on which the computation acts. The stack organizes the
program's procedure calls. A given computer typically has many processes
but only a single kernel.

When a process needs to invoke a kernel service, it invokes a *system
call*, one of the calls in the operating system's interface. The system
call enters the kernel; the kernel performs the service and returns.
Thus a process alternates between executing in *user space* and *kernel
space*.

As described in detail in subsequent chapters, the kernel uses the
hardware protection mechanisms provided by a CPU[^1] to ensure that each
process executing in user space can access only its own memory. The
kernel executes with the hardware privileges required to implement these
protections; user programs execute without those privileges. When a user
program invokes a system call, the hardware raises the privilege level
and starts executing a pre-arranged function in the kernel.

![A kernel and two user processes.](fig/os.pdf){#fig:os}

The collection of system calls that a kernel provides is the interface
that user programs see. The xv6 kernel provides a subset of the services
and system calls that Unix kernels traditionally offer.
Figure [\[fig:api\]](#fig:api){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:api"}
lists all of xv6's system calls.

The rest of this chapter outlines xv6's services---processes, memory,
file descriptors, pipes, and a file system---and illustrates them with
code snippets and discussions of how the *shell*, Unix's command-line
user interface, uses them. The shell's use of system calls illustrates
how carefully they have been designed.

The shell is an ordinary program that reads commands from the user and
executes them. The fact that the shell is a user program, and not part
of the kernel, illustrates the power of the system call interface: there
is nothing special about the shell. It also means that the shell is easy
to replace; as a result, modern Unix systems have a variety of shells to
choose from, each with its own user interface and scripting features.
The xv6 shell is a simple implementation of the essence of the Unix
Bourne shell.

The implementation of the xv6 shell can be found at
[([7850]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c). ([The
link]{style="color: blue"} is a hyperlink to the relevant xv6 source
code at <https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv/> and the specific number
refers to the sheet and line number in
[xv6-src-booklet.pdf](xv6-src-booklet.pdf), as in the Lions' Commentary
on UNIX 6th Edition [@lions]. A good practice is to try to read the
source code first on your own (in your favorite development environment,
on github, or in a PDF viewer) and then come back to this book. By the
end of this book you should be able to understand every line of xv6
source code without having to consult this book.

Processes and memory
--------------------

An xv6 process consists of user-space memory (instructions, data, and
stack) and per-process state private to the kernel. Xv6 *time-share*s
processes: it transparently switches the available CPUs among the set of
processes waiting to execute. When a process is not executing, xv6 saves
the process's CPU registers, restoring them when it next runs the
process. The kernel associates a process identifier, or `PID`, with each
process.

  **System call**                          **Description**

  int chdir(char \*dir)                    Change the current directory.
  int mkdir(char \*dir)                    Create a new directory.
  int mknod(char \*file, int, int)         Create a device file.
  int fstat(int fd, struct stat \*st)      Place info about an open file into \*st.
  int link(char \*file1, char \*file2)     Create another name (file2) for the file file1.
  int unlink(char \*file)                  Remove a file.

A process may create a new process using the `fork` system call. `fork`
gives the new process an exact copy of the calling process's memory:
`fork` copies the instructions, data, and stack of the calling process
into the new process's memory. `fork` returns in both the original and
new processes. In the original process, `fork` returns the new process's
PID. In the new process, `fork` returns zero. The original and new
processes are often called the *parent* and *child*.

For example, consider the following program fragment written in the C
programming language [@kernighan]:

    int pid = fork();
    if(pid > 0){
      printf("parent: child=%d\n", pid);
      pid = wait((int *) 0);
      printf("child %d is done\n", pid);
    } else if(pid == 0){
      printf("child: exiting\n");
      exit(0);
    } else {
      printf("fork error\n");
    }

The `exit` system call causes the calling process to stop executing and
to release resources such as memory and open files. Exit takes an
integer status argument, conventionally 0 to indicate success and 1 to
indicate failure. The `wait` system call returns the PID of an exited
(or killed) child of the current process and copies the exit status of
the child to the address passed to wait; if none of the caller's
children has exited, `wait` waits for one to do so. If the caller has no
children, `wait` immediately returns -1. If the parent doesn't care
about the exit status of a child, it can pass a 0 address to `wait`.

In the example, the output lines

    parent: child=1234
    child: exiting

might come out in either order (or even intermixed), depending on
whether the parent or child gets to its `printf` call first. After the
child exits, the parent's `wait` returns, causing the parent to print

    parent: child 1234 is done

Although the child starts with a copy of the parent's memory, the parent
and child execute with separate memory and separate registers: changing
a variable in one does not affect the other. For example, when the
return value of `wait` is stored into `pid` in the parent process, it
doesn't change the variable `pid` in the child. The value of `pid` in
the child will still be zero.

The `exec` system call replaces the calling process's memory with a new
memory image loaded from a file stored in the file system. The file must
have a particular format, which specifies which part of the file holds
instructions, which part is data, at which instruction to start, etc.
Xv6 uses the ELF format, which Chapter [3](#CH:MEM){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:MEM"} discusses in more detail. Usually the file is the
result of compiling a program's source code. When `exec` succeeds, it
does not return to the calling program; instead, the instructions loaded
from the file start executing at the entry point declared in the ELF
header. `exec` takes two arguments: the name of the file containing the
executable and an array of string arguments. For example:

    char *argv[3];

    argv[0] = "echo";
    argv[1] = "hello";
    argv[2] = 0;
    exec("/bin/echo", argv);
    printf("exec error\n");

This fragment replaces the calling program with an instance of the
program `/bin/echo` running with the argument list `echo` `hello`. Most
programs ignore the first element of the argument array, which is
conventionally the name of the program.

The xv6 shell uses the above calls to run programs on behalf of users.
The main structure of the shell is simple; see `main`
[([8001]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L146). The
main loop reads a line of input from the user with `getcmd`. Then it
calls `fork`, which creates a copy of the shell process. The parent
calls `wait`, while the child runs the command. For example, if the user
had typed "`echo hello`" to the shell, `runcmd` would have been called
with "`echo hello`" as the argument. `runcmd`
[([7903]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L55) runs the
actual command. For "`echo hello`", it would call `exec`
[([7927]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L79). If
`exec` succeeds then the child will execute instructions from `echo`
instead of `runcmd`. At some point `echo` will call `exit`, which will
cause the parent to return from `wait` in `main`
[([8001]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L146).

You might wonder why `fork` and `exec` are not combined in a single
call; we will see later that the shell exploits the separation in its
implementation of I/O redirection. To avoid the wastefulness of creating
a duplicate process and then immediately replacing it (with `exec`),
operating kernels optimize the implementation of `fork` for this use
case by using virtual memory techniques such as copy-on-write (see
Section [5](#CH:PGFAULTS){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:PGFAULTS"}).

Xv6 allocates most user-space memory implicitly: `fork` allocates the
memory required for the child's copy of the parent's memory, and `exec`
allocates enough memory to hold the executable file. A process that
needs more memory at run-time (perhaps for `malloc`) can call `sbrk(n)`
to grow its data memory by `n` zero bytes; `sbrk` returns the location
of the new memory.

I/O and File descriptors
------------------------

A *file descriptor* is a small integer representing a kernel-managed
object that a process may read from or write to. A process may obtain a
file descriptor by opening a file, directory, or device, or by creating
a pipe, or by duplicating an existing descriptor. For simplicity we'll
often refer to the object a file descriptor refers to as a "file"; the
file descriptor interface abstracts away the differences between files,
pipes, and devices, making them all look like streams of bytes. We'll
refer to input and output as *I/O*.

Internally, the xv6 kernel uses the file descriptor as an index into a
per-process table, so that every process has a private space of file
descriptors starting at zero. By convention, a process reads from file
descriptor 0 (standard input), writes output to file descriptor 1
(standard output), and writes error messages to file descriptor 2
(standard error). As we will see, the shell exploits the convention to
implement I/O redirection and pipelines. The shell ensures that it
always has three file descriptors open
[([8007]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L152), which
are by default file descriptors for the console.

The `read` and `write` system calls read bytes from and write bytes to
open files named by file descriptors. The call `read(fd`, `buf`, `n)`
reads at most `n` bytes from the file descriptor `fd`, copies them into
`buf`, and returns the number of bytes read. Each file descriptor that
refers to a file has an offset associated with it. `read` reads data
from the current file offset and then advances that offset by the number
of bytes read: a subsequent `read` will return the bytes following the
ones returned by the first `read`. When there are no more bytes to read,
`read` returns zero to indicate the end of the file.

The call `write(fd`, `buf`, `n)` writes `n` bytes from `buf` to the file
descriptor `fd` and returns the number of bytes written. Fewer than `n`
bytes are written only when an error occurs. Like `read`, `write` writes
data at the current file offset and then advances that offset by the
number of bytes written: each `write` picks up where the previous one
left off.

The following program fragment (which forms the essence of the program
`cat`) copies data from its standard input to its standard output. If an
error occurs, it writes a message to the standard error.

    char buf[512];
    int n;

    for(;;){
      n = read(0, buf, sizeof buf);
      if(n == 0)
        break;
      if(n < 0){
        fprintf(2, "read error\n");
        exit(1);
      }
      if(write(1, buf, n) != n){
        fprintf(2, "write error\n");
        exit(1);
      }
    }

The important thing to note in the code fragment is that `cat` doesn't
know whether it is reading from a file, console, or a pipe. Similarly
`cat` doesn't know whether it is printing to a console, a file, or
whatever. The use of file descriptors and the convention that file
descriptor 0 is input and file descriptor 1 is output allows a simple
implementation of `cat`.

The `close` system call releases a file descriptor, making it free for
reuse by a future `open`, `pipe`, or `dup` system call (see below). A
newly allocated file descriptor is always the lowest-numbered unused
descriptor of the current process.

File descriptors and `fork` interact to make I/O redirection easy to
implement. `fork` copies the parent's file descriptor table along with
its memory, so that the child starts with exactly the same open files as
the parent. The system call `exec` replaces the calling process's memory
but preserves its file table. This behavior allows the shell to
implement *I/O redirection* by forking, closing and re-opening chosen
file descriptors in the child, and then calling `exec` to run the new
program. Here is a simplified version of the code a shell runs for the
command `cat` `<` `input.txt`:

    char *argv[2];

    argv[0] = "cat";
    argv[1] = 0;
    if(fork() == 0) {
      close(0);
      open("input.txt", O_RDONLY);
      exec("cat", argv);
    }

After the child closes file descriptor 0, `open` is guaranteed to use
that file descriptor for the newly opened `input.txt`: 0 will be the
smallest available file descriptor. `cat` then executes with file
descriptor 0 (standard input) referring to `input.txt`. The parent
process's file descriptors are not changed by this sequence, since it
modifies only the child's descriptors.

The code for I/O redirection in the xv6 shell works in exactly this way
[([7931]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L83). Recall
that at this point in the code the shell has already forked the child
shell and that `runcmd` will call `exec` to load the new program.

The second argument to `open` consists of a set of flags, expressed as
bits, that control what `open` does. The possible values are defined in
the file control (fcntl) header
[[(4000-4004)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fcntl.h#L1-L5):
`O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`, `O_CREATE`, and `O_TRUNC`, which
instruct `open` to open the file for reading, or for writing, or for
both reading and writing, to create the file if it doesn't exist, and to
truncate the file to zero length.

Now it should be clear why it is helpful that `fork` and `exec` are
separate calls: between the two, the shell has a chance to redirect the
child's I/O without disturbing the I/O setup of the main shell. One
could instead imagine a hypothetical combined `forkexec` system call,
but the options for doing I/O redirection with such a call seem awkward.
The shell could modify its own I/O setup before calling `forkexec` (and
then un-do those modifications); or `forkexec` could take instructions
for I/O redirection as arguments; or (least attractively) every program
like `cat` could be taught to do its own I/O redirection.

Although `fork` copies the file descriptor table, each underlying file
offset is shared between parent and child. Consider this example:

    if(fork() == 0) {
      write(1, "hello ", 6);
      exit(0);
    } else {
      wait(0);
      write(1, "world\n", 6);
    }

At the end of this fragment, the file attached to file descriptor 1 will
contain the data `hello` `world`. The `write` in the parent (which,
thanks to `wait`, runs only after the child is done) picks up where the
child's `write` left off. This behavior helps produce sequential output
from sequences of shell commands, like `(echo` `hello`; `echo` `world)`
`>output.txt`.

The `dup` system call duplicates an existing file descriptor, returning
a new one that refers to the same underlying I/O object. Both file
descriptors share an offset, just as the file descriptors duplicated by
`fork` do. This is another way to write `hello` `world` into a file:

    fd = dup(1);
    write(1, "hello ", 6);
    write(fd, "world\n", 6);

Two file descriptors share an offset if they were derived from the same
original file descriptor by a sequence of `fork` and `dup` calls.
Otherwise file descriptors do not share offsets, even if they resulted
from `open` calls for the same file. `dup` allows shells to implement
commands like this: `ls` `existing-file` `non-existing-file` `>` `tmp1`
`2>&1`. The `2>&1` tells the shell to give the command a file descriptor
2 that is a duplicate of descriptor 1. Both the name of the existing
file and the error message for the non-existing file will show up in the
file `tmp1`. The xv6 shell doesn't support I/O redirection for the error
file descriptor, but now you know how to implement it.

File descriptors are a powerful abstraction, because they hide the
details of what they are connected to: a process writing to file
descriptor 1 may be writing to a file, to a device like the console, or
to a pipe.

Pipes
-----

A *pipe* is a small kernel buffer exposed to processes as a pair of file
descriptors, one for reading and one for writing. Writing data to one
end of the pipe makes that data available for reading from the other end
of the pipe. Pipes provide a way for processes to communicate.

The following example code runs the program `wc` with standard input
connected to the read end of a pipe.

    int p[2];
    char *argv[2];

    argv[0] = "wc";
    argv[1] = 0;

    pipe(p);
    if(fork() == 0) {
      close(0);
      dup(p[0]);
      close(p[0]);
      close(p[1]);
      exec("/bin/wc", argv);
    } else {
      close(p[0]);
      write(p[1], "hello world\n", 12);
      close(p[1]);
    }

The program calls `pipe`, which creates a new pipe and records the read
and write file descriptors in the array `p`. After `fork`, both parent
and child have file descriptors referring to the pipe. The child calls
`close` and `dup` to make file descriptor zero refer to the read end of
the pipe, closes the file descriptors in `p`, and calls `exec` to run
`wc`. When `wc` reads from its standard input, it reads from the pipe.
The parent closes the read side of the pipe, writes to the pipe, and
then closes the write side.

If no data is available, a `read` on a pipe waits for either data to be
written or for all file descriptors referring to the write end to be
closed; in the latter case, `read` will return 0, just as if the end of
a data file had been reached. The fact that `read` blocks until it is
impossible for new data to arrive is one reason that it's important for
the child to close the write end of the pipe before executing `wc`
above: if one of `wc` 's file descriptors referred to the write end of
the pipe, `wc` would never see end-of-file.

The xv6 shell implements pipelines such as `grep fork sh.c | wc -l` in a
manner similar to the above code
[([7950]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L101). The
child process creates a pipe to connect the left end of the pipeline
with the right end. Then it calls `fork` and `runcmd` for the left end
of the pipeline and `fork` and `runcmd` for the right end, and waits for
both to finish. The right end of the pipeline may be a command that
itself includes a pipe (e.g., `a` `|` `b` `|` `c)`, which itself forks
two new child processes (one for `b` and one for `c`). Thus, the shell
may create a tree of processes. The leaves of this tree are commands and
the interior nodes are processes that wait until the left and right
children complete.

Pipes may seem no more powerful than temporary files: the pipeline

    echo hello world | wc

could be implemented without pipes as

    echo hello world >/tmp/xyz; wc </tmp/xyz

Pipes have at least three advantages over temporary files in this
situation. First, pipes automatically clean themselves up; with the file
redirection, a shell would have to be careful to remove `/tmp/xyz` when
done. Second, pipes can pass arbitrarily long streams of data, while
file redirection requires enough free space on disk to store all the
data. Third, pipes allow for parallel execution of pipeline stages,
while the file approach requires the first program to finish before the
second starts.

File system
-----------

The xv6 file system provides data files, which contain uninterpreted
byte arrays, and directories, which contain named references to data
files and other directories. The directories form a tree, starting at a
special directory called the *root*. A *path* like `/a/b/c` refers to
the file or directory named `c` inside the directory named `b` inside
the directory named `a` in the root directory `/`. Paths that don't
begin with `/` are evaluated relative to the calling process's *current
directory*, which can be changed with the `chdir` system call. Both
these code fragments open the same file (assuming all the directories
involved exist):

    chdir("/a");
    chdir("b");
    open("c", O_RDONLY);

    open("/a/b/c", O_RDONLY);

The first fragment changes the process's current directory to `/a/b`;
the second neither refers to nor changes the process's current
directory.

There are system calls to create new files and directories: `mkdir`
creates a new directory, `open` with the `O_CREATE` flag creates a new
data file, and `mknod` creates a new device file. This example
illustrates all three:

    mkdir("/dir");
    fd = open("/dir/file", O_CREATE|O_WRONLY);
    close(fd);
    mknod("/console", 1, 1);

`mknod` creates a special file that refers to a device. Associated with
a device file are the major and minor device numbers (the two arguments
to `mknod`), which uniquely identify a kernel device. When a process
later opens a device file, the kernel diverts `read` and `write` system
calls to the kernel device implementation instead of passing them to the
file system.

A file's name is distinct from the file itself; the same underlying
file, called an *inode*, can have multiple names, called *links*. Each
link consists of an entry in a directory; the entry contains a file name
and a reference to an inode. An inode holds *metadata* about a file,
including its type (file or directory or device), its length, the
location of the file's content on disk, and the number of links to a
file.

The `fstat` system call retrieves information from the inode that a file
descriptor refers to. It fills in a `struct` `stat`, defined in `stat.h`
[([4050]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/stat.h) as:

    #define T_DIR     1   // Directory
    #define T_FILE    2   // File
    #define T_DEVICE  3   // Device

    struct stat {
      int dev;     // File system's disk device
      uint ino;    // Inode number
      short type;  // Type of file
      short nlink; // Number of links to file
      uint64 size; // Size of file in bytes
    };

The `link` system call creates another file system name referring to the
same inode as an existing file. This fragment creates a new file named
both `a` and `b`.

    open("a", O_CREATE|O_WRONLY);
    link("a", "b");

Reading from or writing to `a` is the same as reading from or writing to
`b`. Each inode is identified by a unique *inode* *number*. After the
code sequence above, it is possible to determine that `a` and `b` refer
to the same underlying contents by inspecting the result of `fstat`:
both will return the same inode number (`ino`), and the `nlink` count
will be set to 2.

The `unlink` system call removes a name from the file system. The file's
inode and the disk space holding its content are only freed when the
file's link count is zero and no file descriptors refer to it. Thus
adding

    unlink("a");

to the last code sequence leaves the inode and file content accessible
as `b`. Furthermore,

    fd = open("/tmp/xyz", O_CREATE|O_RDWR);
    unlink("/tmp/xyz");

is an idiomatic way to create a temporary inode with no name that will
be cleaned up when the process closes `fd` or exits.

Unix provides file utilities callable from the shell as user-level
programs, for example `mkdir`, `ln`, and `rm`. This design allows anyone
to extend the command-line interface by adding new user-level programs.
In hindsight this plan seems obvious, but other systems designed at the
time of Unix often built such commands into the shell (and built the
shell into the kernel).

One exception is `cd`, which is built into the shell
[([8021]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/sh.c#L166). `cd`
must change the current working directory of the shell itself. If `cd`
were run as a regular command, then the shell would fork a child
process, the child process would run `cd`, and `cd` would change the
*child* 's working directory. The parent's (i.e., the shell's) working
directory would not change.

Real world
----------

Unix's combination of "standard" file descriptors, pipes, and convenient
shell syntax for operations on them was a major advance in writing
general-purpose reusable programs. The idea sparked a culture of
"software tools" that was responsible for much of Unix's power and
popularity, and the shell was the first so-called "scripting language."
The Unix system call interface persists today in systems like BSD,
Linux, and macOS.

The Unix system call interface has been standardized through the
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard. Xv6 is *not* POSIX
compliant: it is missing many system calls (including basic ones such as
`lseek`), and many of the system calls it does provide differ from the
standard. Our main goals for xv6 are simplicity and clarity while
providing a simple UNIX-like system-call interface. Several people have
extended xv6 with a few more system calls and a simple C library in
order to run basic Unix programs. Modern kernels, however, provide many
more system calls, and many more kinds of kernel services, than xv6. For
example, they support networking, windowing systems, user-level threads,
drivers for many devices, and so on. Modern kernels evolve continuously
and rapidly, and offer many features beyond POSIX.

Unix unified access to multiple types of resources (files, directories,
and devices) with a single set of file-name and file-descriptor
interfaces. This idea can be extended to more kinds of resources; a good
example is Plan 9 [@Presotto91plan9], which applied the "resources are
files" concept to networks, graphics, and more. However, most
Unix-derived operating systems have not followed this route.

The file system and file descriptors have been powerful abstractions.
Even so, there are other models for operating system interfaces.
Multics, a predecessor of Unix, abstracted file storage in a way that
made it look like memory, producing a very different flavor of
interface. The complexity of the Multics design had a direct influence
on the designers of Unix, who aimed to build something simpler.

Xv6 does not provide a notion of users or of protecting one user from
another; in Unix terms, all xv6 processes run as root.

This book examines how xv6 implements its Unix-like interface, but the
ideas and concepts apply to more than just Unix. Any operating system
must multiplex processes onto the underlying hardware, isolate processes
from each other, and provide mechanisms for controlled inter-process
communication. After studying xv6, you should be able to look at other,
more complex operating systems and see the concepts underlying xv6 in
those systems as well.

Operating system organization {#CH:FIRST}
=============================

A key requirement for an operating system is to support several
activities at once. For example, one might use the `fork` and `exec`
system calls from Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:UNIX"} to start both a compiler and a text editor as
processes. The operating system must *time-share* resources such as CPUs
and memory among these processes. The operating system must also arrange
for *isolation* between the processes. If one process has a bug and
malfunctions, it shouldn't affect unrelated processes. Complete
isolation, however, is too strong, since it should be possible for
processes to intentionally interact; pipelines are an example. Thus an
operating system must fulfill three requirements: multiplexing,
isolation, and interaction.

This chapter provides an overview of how operating systems are organized
to achieve these three requirements. It turns out there are many ways to
do so, but this text focuses on mainstream designs centered around a
*monolithic kernel*, which is used by many Unix operating systems. This
chapter also provides an overview of an xv6 process, the unit of
isolation in xv6.

Xv6 runs on a *multi-core*[^2] RISC-V microprocessor, and much of its
low-level functionality (for example, its process implementation) is
specific to RISC-V. RISC-V is a 64-bit CPU, and xv6 is written in "LP64"
C, which means long (L) and pointers (P) in the C programming language
are 64 bits, but an `int` is 32 bits. This book assumes the reader has
done a bit of machine-level programming on some architecture, and will
introduce RISC-V-specific ideas as they come up. The user-level
ISA [@riscv:user] and privileged architecture [@riscv:priv] documents
are the complete specifications. You may also refer to "The RISC-V
Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas" [@riscv].

The CPU in a complete computer is surrounded by support hardware, much
of it in the form of I/O interfaces. Xv6 is written for the support
hardware simulated by qemu's "-machine virt" option. This includes RAM,
a ROM containing boot code, a serial connection to the user's
keyboard/screen, and a disk for storage.

Abstracting physical resources
------------------------------

The first question one might ask when encountering an operating system
is why have it at all? That is, one could implement the system calls in
Figure [\[fig:api\]](#fig:api){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:api"}
as a library, with which applications link. In this plan, each
application could even have its own library tailored to its needs.
Applications could directly interact with hardware resources and use
those resources in the best way for the application (e.g., to achieve
high or predictable performance). Some operating systems for embedded
devices or real-time systems are organized in this way.

The downside of this library approach is that, if there is more than one
application running, the applications must be well-behaved. For example,
each application must periodically give up the CPU so that other
applications can run. Such a *cooperative* time-sharing scheme may be OK
if all applications trust each other and have no bugs. It's more typical
for applications to not trust each other, and to have bugs, so one often
wants stronger isolation than a cooperative scheme provides.

To achieve strong isolation it's helpful to forbid applications from
directly accessing sensitive hardware resources, and instead to abstract
the resources into services. For example, Unix applications interact
with storage only through the file system's `open`, `read`, `write`, and
`close` system calls, instead of reading and writing the disk directly.
This provides the application with the convenience of pathnames, and it
allows the operating system (which provides the interface) to manage the
disk. Even if isolation is not a concern, programs that interact
intentionally (or just wish to keep out of each other's way) are likely
to find a file system a more convenient abstraction than direct use of
the disk.

Similarly, Unix transparently switches hardware CPUs among processes,
saving and restoring register state as necessary, so that applications
don't have to be aware of time-sharing. This transparency allows the
operating system to share CPUs even if some applications are in infinite
loops.

As another example, Unix processes use `exec` to build up their memory
image, instead of directly interacting with physical memory. This allows
the operating system to decide where to place a process in memory; if
memory is tight, the operating system might even store some of a
process's data on disk. `exec` also provides users with the convenience
of a file system to store executable program images.

Many forms of interaction among Unix processes occur via file
descriptors. Not only do file descriptors abstract away many details
(e.g., where data in a pipe or file is stored), they are also defined in
a way that simplifies interaction. For example, if one application in a
pipeline exits or fails, the kernel automatically generates an
end-of-file signal for the next process in the pipeline.

The system-call interface in
Figure [\[fig:api\]](#fig:api){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:api"}
is carefully designed to provide both programmer convenience and the
possibility of strong isolation. The Unix interface is not the only way
to abstract resources, but it has proved to be a good one.

User mode, supervisor mode, and system calls
--------------------------------------------

Strong isolation requires a hard boundary between applications and the
operating system. Applications shouldn't be allowed to disturb the
operation of the operating system or other programs, even if the
application has a bug or is malicious. To achieve strong isolation, the
operating system must arrange that applications cannot modify (or even
read) the operating system's data structures and instructions and that
applications cannot access other processes' memory.

CPUs provide hardware support for strong isolation. For example, RISC-V
has three privilege levels which constrain what code can do: *machine
mode*, *supervisor mode*, and *user mode*. Instructions executing in
machine mode have full privilege; a CPU starts in machine mode. Machine
mode is mostly intended for setting up the computer during boot. Xv6
executes briefly in machine mode and then changes to supervisor mode.

In supervisor mode the CPU is allowed to execute *privileged
instructions*: for example, enabling and disabling interrupts, reading
and writing the register that holds the address of the page table, etc.
If an application in user mode attempts to execute a privileged
instruction, then the CPU doesn't execute the instruction, but "traps"
to special code in supervisor mode that can terminate the application.
Figure [1.1](#fig:os){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:os"} in
Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:UNIX"}
illustrates this organization. An application can execute only user-mode
instructions (e.g., adding numbers, etc.) and is said to be running in
*user space*, while the software in supervisor mode can also execute
privileged instructions and is said to be running in *kernel space*. The
software running in kernel space (or in supervisor mode) is called the
*kernel*.

Applications interact with the kernel via system calls calls such as
`read`. Applications are not allowed to directly call kernel functions
or access the kernel's memory. RISC-V provides the `ecall` instruction
for system calls; it switches the CPU from user to supervisor mode and
jumps to a kernel-specified entry point. Once the CPU has switched to
supervisor mode, the kernel can then validate the arguments of the
system call (e.g., check if the address passed to the system call is
part of the application's memory), decide whether the application is
allowed to perform the requested operation (e.g., check if the
application is allowed to write the specified file), and then deny it or
execute it. It is important that the kernel control the entry point for
transitions to supervisor mode; if the application could decide the
kernel entry point, a malicious application could, for example, enter
the kernel at a point where the validation of arguments is skipped.

Kernel organization
-------------------

A key design question is what part of the operating system should run in
supervisor mode. One possibility is that the entire operating system
resides in the kernel, so that the implementations of all system calls
run in supervisor mode. This organization is called a *monolithic
kernel*.

In a monolithic organization the entire operating system consists of a
single program running in supervisor mode. One reason this organization
is convenient is that the OS designer doesn't have to divide code into
parts that do and do not require supervisor privileges. Furthermore, it
is easy for different parts of the operating system to cooperate, since
they are parts of a single program. For example, a monolithic kernel
might share a disk block cache with the file system and the virtual
memory system.

A downside is that monolithic kernels tend to grow large and complex, so
that no one developer understands all of the interactions between
different parts of the code; this is a recipe for bugs. A bug in the
kernel is particularly troublesome because it may cause the entire
computer to crash, or cause many applications to malfunction, or make
the entire computer vulnerable to security attacks.

A *microkernel* aims to reduce the incidence of bugs in the kernel. The
idea is to put an absolute minimum of functionality in the kernel
itself, so that little code executes in supervisor mode, and so that the
kernel is easy to understand and analyze for correctness. The bulk of
the operating system runs as user-level server processes. For example,
the file system code would execute as a server process, in user mode
rather than supervisor mode.

![A microkernel with a file-system
server](fig/mkernel.pdf){#fig:mkernel}

Figure [2.1](#fig:mkernel){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mkernel"}
illustrates this microkernel design. In the figure, the file system runs
as a user-level server process. To allow applications to interact with
the file server, the kernel provides an inter-process communication
mechanism to send messages from one user-mode process to another. For
example, if an application like the shell wants to read or write a file,
it sends a message to the file server and waits for a response.

In a microkernel, the kernel interface consists of a few low-level
functions for starting applications, sending messages, accessing device
hardware, etc. This organization allows the kernel to be relatively
simple, as most of the operating system resides in user-level servers.

In the real world, both monolithic kernels and microkernels are popular.
Many Unix kernels are monolithic. For example, Linux has a monolithic
kernel, although some OS functions run as user-level servers (e.g., the
window system). Linux delivers high performance to OS-intensive
applications, partially because the subsystems of the kernel can be
tightly integrated.

Operating systems such as Minix, L4, and QNX are organized as a
microkernel with servers, and have seen wide deployment in embedded
settings. A variant of L4, seL4, is small enough that it has been
verified for memory safety and other security properties [@sel4].

There is much debate among developers of operating systems about which
organization is better, but there is no conclusive evidence one way or
the other. Furthermore, it depends much on what "better" means: faster
performance, smaller code size, reliability of the kernel, reliability
of the complete operating system (including user-level services), etc.

There are also practical considerations that may be more important than
the question of which organization. Some operating systems have a
microkernel but run some of the user-level services in kernel space for
performance reasons. Some operating systems have monolithic kernels
because that is how they started and there is little incentive to move
to a pure microkernel organization, because new features may be more
important than rewriting the existing operating system to fit a
microkernel design.

From this book's perspective, microkernel and monolithic operating
systems share many key ideas. They implement system calls, they use page
tables, they handle interrupts, they support processes, they use locks
for concurrency control, they implement a file system, etc. This book
focuses on these core ideas.

Xv6 is implemented as a monolithic kernel, like most Unix operating
systems. Thus, the xv6 kernel interface corresponds to the operating
system interface, and the kernel implements the complete operating
system. Since xv6 doesn't provide many services, its kernel is smaller
than some microkernels, but conceptually xv6 is monolithic.

The xv6 kernel source is in the `kernel/` sub-directory.

reference="fig:source"} lists the files, divided into the major areas of
kernel responsibility: starting the system (booting), creating and
controlling processes, handling traps (interrupts and system calls),
allocating memory and configuring virtual addresses, controlling
devices, and managing the file-system.

Process overview
----------------

The unit of isolation in xv6 (as in other Unix operating systems) is a
*process*. The process abstraction prevents one process from wrecking or
spying on another process's memory, CPU, file descriptors, etc. It also
prevents a process from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process
can't subvert the kernel's isolation mechanisms. The kernel must
implement the process abstraction with care because a buggy or malicious
application may trick the kernel or hardware into doing something bad
(e.g., circumventing isolation). The mechanisms used by the kernel to
implement processes include the user/supervisor mode flag, address
spaces, and time-slicing of threads.

To help enforce isolation, the process abstraction provides the illusion
to a program that it has its own private machine. A process provides a
program with what appears to be a private memory system, or *address
space*, which other processes cannot read or write. A process also
provides the program with what appears to be its own CPU to execute the
program's instructions.

Xv6 uses page tables (which are implemented by hardware) to give each
process its own address space. The RISC-V page table translates (or
"maps") a *virtual address* (the address that an RISC-V instruction
manipulates) to a *physical address* (an address that the CPU sends to
main memory).

![Layout of a process's virtual address space](fig/as.pdf){#fig:as}

Xv6 maintains a separate page table for each process that defines that
process's address space. As illustrated in
Figure [2.2](#fig:as){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:as"}, an
address space includes the process's *user memory* starting at virtual
address zero. Instructions come first, followed by global variables,
then the stack, and finally a "heap" area (for malloc) that the process
can expand as needed. There are a number of factors that limit the
maximum size of a process's address space: pointers on the RISC-V are 64
bits wide; the hardware uses only the low 39 bits when looking up
virtual addresses in page tables; and xv6 uses only 38 of those 39 bits.
Thus, the maximum address is $2^{38}-1$ = 0x3fffffffff, which is
`MAXVA` [([0899]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/riscv.h#L380).
At the top of the address space xv6 places a *trampoline* page (4096
bytes) and a *trapframe* page. Xv6 uses these two pages to transition
into the kernel and back; the trampoline page contains the code to
transition in and out of the kernel, and the trapframe is where the
kernel saves the process's user registers, as
Chapter [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:TRAP"}
explains.

The xv6 kernel maintains many pieces of state for each process, which it
gathers into a `struct proc`
[([2034]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.h#L85). A
process's most important pieces of kernel state are its page table, its
kernel stack, and its run state. We'll use the notation `p->xxx` to
refer to elements of the `proc` structure; for example, `p->pagetable`
is a pointer to the process's page table.

At this point, please read `kernel/proc.h`, which defines
` struct proc`. The xv6 code is more important for you to understand
than this book; you should prioritize the code, and consult this book as
needed to clarify the code. The purpose of some of the code may not be
apparent at first, but further reading and searching the code will help.
Feel free to explore and modify the code.

Each process has a thread of control (or *thread* for short) that holds
the state needed to execute the process. At any given time, a thread
might be executing on a CPU, or suspended (not executing, but capable of
resuming executing in the future). To switch a CPU between processes,
the kernel suspends the thread currently running on that CPU and saves
its state, and restores the state of another process's
previously-suspended thread. Much of the state of a thread (local
variables, function call return addresses) is stored on the thread's
stacks. Each process has two stacks: a user stack and a kernel stack
(`p->kstack`). When the process is executing user instructions, only its
user stack is in use, and its kernel stack is empty. When the process
enters the kernel (for a system call or interrupt), the kernel code
executes on the process's kernel stack; while a process is in the
kernel, its user stack still contains saved data, but isn't actively
used. A process's thread alternates between actively using its user
stack and its kernel stack. The kernel stack is separate (and protected
from user code) so that the kernel can execute even if a process has
wrecked its user stack.

A process's user code can make a system call by executing the RISC-V
`ecall` instruction. This instruction switches to supervisor mode and
changes the program counter to a kernel-defined entry point. The code at
the entry point switches to the process's kernel stack and executes the
kernel instructions that implement the system call. When the system call
completes, the kernel returns to user space by executin the `sret`
instruction, which switches to user mode and resumes executing user
instructions just after the system call instruction. A process's thread
can "block" in the kernel to wait for I/O, and resume where it left off
when the I/O has finished.

`p->state` indicates whether the process is allocated, ready to run,
currently running on a CPU, waiting for I/O, or exiting.

`p->pagetable` holds the process's page table, in the format that the
RISC-V hardware expects. Xv6 causes the paging hardware to use a
process's `p->pagetable` when executing that process in user space. A
process's page table also serves as the record of the addresses of the
physical pages allocated to store the process's memory.

In summary, a process bundles two design ideas: an address space to give
a process the illusion of its own memory, and a thread to give the
process the illusion of its own CPU. In xv6, a process consists of one
address space and one thread. In real operating systems a process may
have more than one thread to take advantage of multiple CPUs.

Code: starting xv6, the first process and system call
-----------------------------------------------------

To make xv6 more concrete, we'll outline how the kernel starts and runs
the first process. The subsequent chapters will describe the mechanisms
that show up in this overview in more detail. Please read
`kernel/entry.S`, `kernel/start.c`, `kernel/main.c`, and `user/init.c`.

When the RISC-V computer powers on, it initializes itself and runs a
boot loader which is stored in read-only memory. The boot loader copies
the xv6 kernel into memory at physical address `0x80000000`. The reason
it places the kernel at `0x80000000` rather than `0x0` is because the
address range `0x0:0x80000000` contains I/O devices.

Then the boot loader jumps to xv6 starting at `_entry`
[([1006]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/entry.S#L7). The
RISC-V starts with paging hardware disabled: virtual addresses map
directly to physical addresses. The instructions at `_entry` set up a
stack so that xv6 can run C code. Xv6 declares space for this stack,
`stack0`, in the file `start.c`
[([1060]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/start.c#L11). The
code at `_entry` loads the stack pointer register `sp` with the address
`stack0+4096`, the top of the stack, because the stack on RISC-V grows
down. Now that the kernel has a stack, `_entry` calls into C code at
`start`
[([1064]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/start.c#L15).

The function `start` performs some setup that the CPU only allows in
machine mode, most crucially programming the clock chip to generate
timer interrupts. Then `start` uses the RISC-V `mret` instruction to
switch to supervisor mode and jump to `main`
[([1160]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/main.c#L11).
`mret` requires a bit of setup: `start` sets the previous privilege mode
to supervisor in the register `mstatus`, sets the destination address to
`main` by writing `main`'s address into the register `mepc`, disables
virtual address translation in supervisor mode by writing `0` into the
page-table register `satp`, and delegates all interrupts and exceptions
to supervisor mode.

After `main`
[([1160]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/main.c#L11)
initializes several devices and subsystems, it creates the first process
by calling `userinit`
[([2327]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L220). All
newly created processes start executing in the kernel in `forkret`
[([2653]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L506). As
a special case for the first process, `forkret` calls `kexec` to load
the user program `/init`.

After calling `kexec`, `forkret` returns to user space in the `/init`
process. `init`
[([7764]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/init.c#L15) creates
a new console device file if needed and then opens it as file
descriptors 0, 1, and 2. Then it starts a shell on the console. The
system is up.

Security Model
--------------

You may wonder how the operating system deals with buggy or malicious
code. Because coping with malice is strictly harder than dealing with
accidental bugs, it's reasonable to focus mostly on providing security
against malice. Here's a high-level view of typical security assumptions
and goals in operating system design.

The operating system must assume that a process's user-level code will
do its best to wreck the kernel or other processes. User code may try to
dereference pointers outside its allowed address space; it may attempt
to execute instructions not intended for user code; it may try to read
and write RISC-V control registers; it may try to access device
hardware; and it may pass clever values to system calls in an attempt to
trick the kernel into crashing or doing something stupid.

The kernel's goal is to restrict each user process so that it can only
access its own user memory, use the 32 general-purpose RISC-V registers,
and affect the kernel and other processes in the ways that system calls
are intended to allow. The kernel must prevent any other actions. These
are typically absolute requirements in kernel design.

Expectations for the kernel's own code are different. Kernel code is
assumed to be written by well-meaning and careful programmers, to be
bug-free, and to contain nothing malicious. This assumption affects how
we analyze kernel code. For example, there are many internal kernel
functions (e.g., the spin locks) that would cause serious problems if
kernel code used them incorrectly. We assume, however, that the kernel
uses its own functions correctly. At the hardware level, the RISC-V CPU,
RAM, disk, etc. are assumed to operate as advertised in the
documentation, with no hardware bugs.

Real life is not so straightforward. It's difficult to prevent abusive
user programs from calling system calls in a way that makes the system
unusable by consuming kernel-protected resources: disk space, CPU time,
process table slots, etc. It's usually impossible to write 100% bug-free
kernel code or design bug-free hardware; if the writers of malicious
user code are aware of kernel or hardware bugs, they will exploit them.
Even in mature, widely-used kernels, such as Linux, people often
discover previously-unknown vulnerabilities [@mitre:cves]. Finally, the
distinction between user and kernel code is sometimes blurred: some
privileged user-level processes may provide essential services and
effectively be part of the operating system, and in some operating
systems privileged user code can insert new code into the kernel (as
with Linux's loadable kernel modules and eBPF).

As a partial defense against kernel bugs, xv6 code includes checks for
inconsistencies and unrecoverable errors, and will "panic" in response,
by calling `panic()`. This function prints an error message and halts
the system. Panicking is not desirable, but is preferable to continuing
execution. Typically a panic results from a kernel bug that causes
kernel data to be incorrect or causes the kernel to perform an illegal
action such as referencing non-existent memory; in such a situation it
is safer to halt execution with ` panic()` than to try to continue in an
inconsistent state. A kernel developer would react to a panic by working
to identify and fix the underlying code bug.

Real world
----------

Most operating systems have adopted the process concept, and most
processes look similar to xv6's. Modern operating systems, however,
support several threads within a process, to allow a single process to
exploit multiple CPUs. Supporting multiple threads in a process involves
quite a bit of machinery that xv6 doesn't have, often including
interface changes (e.g., Linux's `clone`, a variant of `fork`), to
control which aspects of a process threads share.

Page tables {#CH:MEM}
===========

Page tables are the most popular mechanism through which the operating
system provides each process with its own private address space and
memory. Page tables determine what memory addresses mean, and what parts
of physical memory can be accessed. They allow xv6 to isolate different
processes' address spaces and to multiplex them onto a single physical
memory. Page tables provide a level of indirection that allows operating
systems to perform many useful tricks. Xv6 performs a few: mapping the
same memory (a trampoline page) in several address spaces, guarding
kernel and user stacks with an unmapped page, and allocating user heap
memory lazily. The rest of this chapter explains the page tables that
the RISC-V hardware provides and how xv6 uses them.

Paging hardware
---------------

As a reminder, RISC-V instructions (both user and kernel) manipulate
virtual addresses. The machine's RAM, or physical memory, is indexed
with physical addresses. The RISC-V page table hardware connects these
two kinds of addresses, by mapping each virtual address to a physical
address.

![An abstract view of a flat page table mapping virtual to physical
addresses.](fig/riscv_address.pdf){#fig:riscv_address}

Xv6 uses RISC-V's Sv39 mode, which means that only the bottom 39 bits of
a 64-bit virtual address are used; the top 25 bits are not used. In this
Sv39 configuration, a RISC-V page table is logically an array of
$2^{27}$ (134,217,728) *page table entries (PTEs)*. Each PTE contains a
44-bit physical page number (PPN) and some flags. The paging hardware
translates a virtual address by using the top 27 bits of the 39 bits to
index into the page table to find a PTE, and making a 56-bit physical
address whose top 44 bits come from the PPN in the PTE and whose bottom
12 bits are copied from the original virtual address.
Figure [3.1](#fig:riscv_address){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_address"} shows this process with a logical view of
the page table as a simple array of PTEs (the RISC-V page table is
actually a tree; see
Figure [3.2](#fig:riscv_pagetable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_pagetable"} for a fuller story). A page table gives
the operating system control over virtual-to-physical address
translations at the granularity of aligned chunks of 4096 ($2^{12}$)
bytes. Such a chunk is called a *page*.

![RISC-V address translation
details.](fig/riscv_pagetable.pdf){#fig:riscv_pagetable}

RISC-V's design leaves room for expansion of both virtual and physical
addresses. If more virtual address space is needed, RISC-V supports an
Sv48 mode, with 48-bit virtual addresses [@riscv:priv]. Physical
addresses also have room for growth: there is room in the PTE format for
the physical page number to grow by another 10 bits. The designers of
RISC-V chose address sizes based on technology predictions. $2^{48}$
bytes is 262,144 GB, a much larger user virtual address space than any
application is likely to use today. $2^{56}$ bytes of physical address
space is 65,536 terabytes, much more RAM than any computer can currently
be equipped with.

As Figure [3.2](#fig:riscv_pagetable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_pagetable"} shows, a RISC-V CPU page table is
stored in physical memory as a three-level tree. The root of the tree is
a 4096-byte page-table page that contains 512 PTEs, which contain the
physical addresses for page-table pages in the next level of the tree.
Each of those pages contains 512 PTEs for the final level in the tree.
The paging hardware uses the top 9 bits of the 27 bits to select a PTE
in the root page-table page, the middle 9 bits to select a PTE in a
page-table page in the next level of the tree, and the bottom 9 bits to
select the final PTE. (In Sv48 RISC-V a page table has four levels, and
bits 39 through 47 of a virtual address index into the top-level.)

If any of the three PTEs required to translate an address is not
present, the paging hardware raises a *page-fault exception*, leaving it
up to the kernel to handle the page fault (see
Chapters [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:TRAP"}
and [5](#CH:PGFAULTS){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:PGFAULTS"}).

The three-level structure of
Figure [3.2](#fig:riscv_pagetable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_pagetable"} allows a memory-efficient way of
recording PTEs, compared to the single-level design of
Figure [3.1](#fig:riscv_address){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_address"}. In the common case in which large ranges
of virtual addresses have no mappings, the three-level structure can
omit entire page directories. For example, if an application uses only a
few pages starting at address zero, then the entries 1 through 511 of
the top-level page directory are invalid, and the kernel doesn't have to
allocate pages those for 511 intermediate page directories. Furthermore,
the kernel also doesn't have to allocate pages for the bottom-level page
directories for those 511 intermediate page directories. So, in this
example, the three-level design saves 511 pages for intermediate page
directories and $511\times512$ pages for bottom-level page directories.

Although a CPU walks the three-level structure in hardware as part of
executing a load or store instruction, a potential downside of three
levels is that the CPU must load three PTEs from memory to perform the
translation of the virtual address in the load/store instruction to a
physical address. To avoid the cost of loading PTEs from physical
memory, a RISC-V CPU caches page table entries in a *Translation
Look-aside Buffer (TLB)*.

Each PTE contains flag bits that tell the paging hardware how the
associated virtual address is allowed to be used. `PTE_V` indicates
whether the PTE is present: if it is not set, a reference to the page
causes a page fault (i.e., is not allowed). `PTE_R` controls whether
instructions are allowed to read to the page. `PTE_W` controls whether
instructions are allowed to write to the page. `PTE_X` controls whether
the CPU may interpret the content of the page as instructions and
execute them. `PTE_U` controls whether instructions in user mode are
allowed to access the page; if `PTE_U` is not set, the PTE can be used
only in supervisor mode.
Figure [3.2](#fig:riscv_pagetable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_pagetable"} shows where the flag bits sit in a PTE.
The flags and all other page hardware-related structures are defined in
[([0500]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/riscv.h)

To tell a CPU to use a page table, the kernel must write the physical
address of the root page-table page into the `satp` register. A CPU will
translate all addresses generated by subsequent instructions using the
page table pointed to by its `satp`. Each CPU has its own `satp` so that
different CPUs can run different processes, each with a private address
space described by its own page table.

From the kernel's point of view, a page table is data stored in memory,
and the kernel creates and modifies page tables using code much like you
might see for any tree-shaped data structure.

A few notes about terms used in this book. *Physical memory* refers to
storage cells in RAM. A byte of physical memory has an address, called a
*physical address*. Instructions that dereference addresses (such as
loads, stores, jumps, and function calls) use only virtual addresses,
which the paging hardware translates to physical addresses, and then
sends to the RAM hardware to read or write storage. An *address space*
is the set of virtual addresses that are valid in a given page table;
each xv6 process has a separate user address space, and the xv6 kernel
has its own address space as well. *User memory* refers to a process's
user address space plus the physical memory that the page table allows
the process to access. *Virtual memory* refers to the ideas and
techniques associated with managing page tables and using them to
achieve goals such as isolation.

address space that xv6 expects to
see.](fig/xv6_layout.pdf){#fig:xv6_layout}

Kernel address space
--------------------

When it starts, xv6 creates a single page table describing the kernel's
address space. The kernel configures the layout of its address space to
give itself access to physical memory and various hardware resources at
predictable virtual addresses.
Figure [3.3](#fig:xv6_layout){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:xv6_layout"} shows how this layout maps kernel virtual
addresses to physical addresses. The file
[([0200]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/memlayout.h)
declares the constants for xv6's kernel memory layout.

QEMU simulates a computer that includes RAM (physical memory) starting
at physical address `0x80000000` and continuing through at least
`0x88000000`, which xv6 calls `PHYSTOP`. The QEMU simulation also
includes I/O devices such as a disk interface. QEMU exposes the device
interfaces to software as *memory-mapped* control registers that sit
below `0x80000000` in the physical address space. The kernel can
interact with the devices by reading/writing these special physical
addresses; such reads and writes communicate with the device hardware
rather than with RAM. Chapter [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:TRAP"} explains how xv6 interacts with devices.

The kernel maps all physical RAM and device registers at virtual
addresses equal to the physical addresses. This is called "direct
mapping," and allows the kernel to read or write physical address $x$
simply by loading or storing to virtual address $x$. The kernel code
itself is located at `KERNBASE=0x80000000` in both the virtual address
space and in physical memory. When `kfork`
[([2376]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L260)
allocates user memory for the child process, the allocator returns the
physical address of that memory; `kfork` uses that address directly as a
virtual address when it is copying the parent's user memory to the
child.

There are a couple of kernel virtual addresses that aren't
direct-mapped:

-   The trampoline page. It is mapped at the top of the virtual address
    space; user page tables have this same mapping.
    Chapter [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:TRAP"}
    discusses the role of the trampoline page, but we see here an
    interesting use case of page tables; a physical page (holding the
    trampoline code) is mapped twice in the virtual address space of the
    kernel: once at the top of the virtual address space and once with a
    direct mapping.

-   The kernel stack pages. Each process has its own kernel stack, which
    is mapped at a high kernel virtual address so that below it xv6 can
    leave an unmapped *guard page*. The guard page's PTE is invalid
    (i.e., `PTE_V` is not set), so that if the kernel overflows a kernel
    stack, it will likely cause a page fault and the kernel will panic.
    Without a guard page an overflowing stack would overwrite other
    kernel memory, resulting in incorrect operation. A panic crash is
    preferable.

While the kernel uses its stacks via the high-memory mappings, each is
also accessible to the kernel through a direct-mapped address. An
alternate design might have just the direct mapping, and use the stacks
at the direct-mapped address. In that arrangement, however, providing
guard pages would involve unmapping virtual addresses that would
otherwise refer to physical memory, which would then be hard to use.

The kernel maps the pages for the trampoline and the kernel text with
the permissions `PTE_R` and `PTE_X`, but not `PTE_W`. The kernel maps
other pages with the permissions `PTE_R` and `PTE_W`, but not `PTE_X`.
The mappings for the guard pages are invalid. The purpose of these
restricted permissions is to help catch kernel bugs that access pages in
unexpected ways, for example if kernel code accidentally tried to write
over kernel instructions.

The kernel creates a single kernel page table, used by all CPUs when
they execute in the kernel. xv6 does not modify the kernel page table
after initially creating it.

Code: creating an address space
-------------------------------

Please read `kernel/vm.c` through the end of `mappages()` before
proceeding.

Most of the xv6 code for manipulating address spaces and page tables
resides in `vm.c`
[([1400]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c). The
central data structure is `pagetable_t`, which is really a pointer to a
RISC-V root page-table page; a `pagetable_t` may be either the kernel
page table, or one of the per-process page tables. The central functions
are `walk`, which finds the PTE for a virtual address, and `mappages`,
which installs PTEs for new mappings. Functions starting with `kvm`
manipulate the kernel page table; functions starting with `uvm`
manipulate a user page table; other functions are used for both.
`copyout` and `copyin` copy data to and from user virtual addresses
provided as system call arguments; they are in `vm.c` because they need
to explicitly translate those addresses in order to find the
corresponding physical memory.

Early in the boot sequence, `main` calls `kvminit`
[([1465]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L66) to
create the kernel's page table using `kvmmake`
[([1421]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L22). This
call occurs before xv6 has enabled paging on the RISC-V, so addresses
refer directly to physical memory. `kvmmake` first allocates a page of
physical memory to hold the root page-table page. Then it calls `kvmmap`
to install the translations that the kernel needs. The translations
include the kernel's instructions and data, physical memory up to
`PHYSTOP`, and memory ranges which are actually devices.
`proc_mapstacks`
[([2132]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L33)
allocates a kernel stack for each process. It calls `kvmmap` to map each
stack at the virtual address generated by `KSTACK`, which leaves room
for the invalid stack-guard pages.

`kvmmap`
[([1457]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L58) calls
`mappages`
[([1556]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L146), which
installs mappings into a page table for a range of virtual addresses to
a corresponding range of physical addresses. It does this separately for
each virtual address in the range, at page intervals. For each virtual
address to be mapped, `mappages` calls `walk` to find the address of the
PTE for that address. It then initializes the PTE to hold the relevant
physical page number, the desired permissions (`PTE_W`, `PTE_X`, and/or
`PTE_R`), and `PTE_V` to mark the PTE as valid
[([1577]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L167).

`walk` [([1497]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L98)
mimics the RISC-V paging hardware as it looks up the PTE for a virtual
address (see Figure [3.2](#fig:riscv_pagetable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:riscv_pagetable"}). `walk` descends the page table tree
one level at a time, using each level's 9 bits of virtual address to
index into the relevant page directory page. At each level it finds
either the PTE of the next level's page directory page, or the PTE of
final page
[([1503]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L104). If a
PTE in a first or second level page directory page isn't valid, then the
required directory page hasn't yet been allocated; if the `alloc`
argument is set, `walk` allocates a new page-table page and puts its
physical address in the PTE. It returns the address of the PTE in the
lowest layer in the tree
[([1513]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L114).

The above code depends on physical memory being direct-mapped into the
kernel virtual address space. For example, as `walk` descends levels of
the page table, it pulls the (physical) address of the next-level-down
page table from a PTE
[([1505]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L106), and
then uses that address as a virtual address to fetch the PTE at the next
level down
[([1503]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L104).

On each CPU, `main` calls `kvminithart`
[([1473]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L74) to
install the kernel page table, placing the physical address of the root
page-table page into the CPU's `satp` register. After this the CPU
translates addresses using the kernel page table. The kernel continues
to execute correctly because the kernel page table is direct-mapped, so
that addresses refer to the same locations in RAM before and after this
change.

Each RISC-V CPU caches page table entries in a *Translation Look-aside
Buffer (TLB)*, and when xv6 changes a page table, it must tell the CPU
to invalidate corresponding cached TLB entries. If it didn't, then at
some point later the TLB might use an old cached mapping, pointing to a
physical page that in the meantime has been allocated to another
process, and as a result, a process might be able to scribble on some
other process's memory. The RISC-V has an instruction `sfence.vma` that
flushes the current CPU's TLB. Xv6 executes `sfence.vma` in
`kvminithart` after reloading the `satp` register, and in the trampoline
code for `uservec` and `userret`.

It is also necessary to issue `sfence.vma` before changing `satp`, in
order to wait for completion of all outstanding loads and stores. This
wait ensures that preceding updates to the page table have completed,
and ensures that preceding loads and stores use the old page table, not
the new one.

Physical memory allocation
--------------------------

The kernel must allocate and free physical memory at run-time for page
tables, user memory, kernel stacks, and pipe buffers.

Xv6 uses the physical memory between the end of the kernel and `PHYSTOP`
for run-time allocation. It allocates and frees whole 4096-byte pages at
a time. It keeps track of which pages are free by threading a linked
list through the pages themselves. Allocation consists of removing a
page from the linked list; freeing consists of adding the freed page to
the list.

Please read `kernel/kalloc.c`.

Code: Physical memory allocator
-------------------------------

The allocator resides in `kalloc.c`
[([2950]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c). The
allocator's data structure is a *free list* of physical memory pages
that are available for allocation. Each free page's "next" pointer
resides in a `struct run`
[([2966]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L17).
The allocator stores each free page's `run` structure in the free page
itself, since there's nothing else stored there while the page is free.
The free list is protected by a spin lock
[[(2970-2973)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L21-L24).
The list and the lock are wrapped in a struct to make clear that the
lock protects the fields in the struct. For now, ignore the lock and the
calls to `acquire` and `release`;
Chapter [7](#CH:LOCK){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:LOCK"} will
examine locking in detail.

The function `main` calls `kinit` to initialize the allocator
[([2976]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L27).
`kinit` initializes the free list to hold every page of physical RAM
between the end of the kernel and `PHYSTOP`. Xv6 ought to determine how
much physical memory is available by parsing configuration information
provided by the hardware. Instead xv6 assumes that the machine has 128
megabytes of RAM. `kinit` calls `freerange` to add memory to the free
list via per-page calls to `kfree`. A PTE can only refer to a physical
address that is aligned on a 4096-byte boundary (is a multiple of 4096),
so `freerange` uses `PGROUNDUP` to ensure that it frees only aligned
physical addresses. The allocator starts with no memory; these calls to
`kfree` give it some to manage.

The allocator sometimes treats addresses as integers in order to perform
arithmetic on them (e.g., traversing all pages in `freerange`), and
sometimes uses addresses as pointers to read and write memory (e.g.,
manipulating the `run` structure stored in each page); this dual use of
addresses is the main reason that the allocator code is full of C
type-casts.

The function `kfree`
[([3005]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L47)
begins by setting every byte in the memory being freed to the value 1.
This will cause code that uses memory after freeing it (uses "dangling
references") to read garbage instead of the old valid contents;
hopefully that will cause such code to break faster. Then `kfree`
prepends the page to the free list: it casts `pa` to a pointer to
`struct` `run`, records the old start of the free list in `r->next`, and
sets the free list equal to `r`. `kalloc` removes and returns the first
element in the free list.

Process address space
---------------------

Each process has its own page table, and when xv6 switches between
processes, it also changes page tables.
Figure [3.4](#fig:processlayout){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:processlayout"} shows a process's address space in more
detail than Figure [2.2](#fig:as){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:as"}. A process's user address space starts at zero and
in principle ends at `MAXVA` (`0x4000000000`)
[([0896]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/riscv.h#L377),
though in practice only a small fraction of this is mapped to physical
memory.

A process's address space consists of pages that contain the text of the
program (which xv6 maps with the permissions `PTE_R`, `PTE_X`, and
`PTE_U`), pages that contain the pre-initialized data of the program, a
page for the stack, and pages for the heap. Xv6 maps the data, stack,
and heap with the permissions `PTE_R`, `PTE_W`, and `PTE_U`.

Using permissions within a user address space is a common technique to
harden a user process. If the text were mapped with `PTE_W`, then a
process could accidentally modify its own program; for example, a
programming error may cause the program to write to a null pointer,
modifying instructions at address 0, and then continue running, perhaps
creating more havoc. To detect such errors immediately, xv6 maps the
text without `PTE_W`; if a program accidentally attempts to store to
address 0, the hardware will refuse to execute the store and raises a
page fault (see Chapter [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:TRAP"}). The kernel then kills the process and prints out
an informative message so that the developer can track down the problem.

Similarly, by mapping data without `PTE_X`, a user program cannot
accidentally jump to an address in the program's data and start
executing at that address.

In the real world, hardening a process by setting permissions carefully
also aids in defending against security attacks. An adversary may feed
carefully-constructed input to a program (e.g., a Web server) that
triggers a bug in the program in the hope of turning that bug into an
exploit [@aleph:smashing]. Setting permissions carefully and other
techniques, such as randomizing of the layout of the user address space,
make such attacks harder.

The stack is a single page, and is shown with the initial contents as
created by the `exec` system call. Strings containing the command-line
arguments, as well as an array of pointers to them, are at the very top
of the stack. Just under that are values that allow a program to start
at `main` as if the function `main(argc`, `argv)` had just been called.

To detect a user stack overflowing the allocated stack memory, xv6
places an inaccessible guard page right below the stack by clearing the
`PTE_U` flag. If the user stack overflows and the process tries to use
an address below the stack, the hardware will generate a page-fault
exception because the guard page is inaccessible to a program running in
user mode. A real-world operating system might instead automatically
allocate more memory for the user stack when it overflows.

We see here a few nice examples of use of page tables. First, different
processes' page tables translate user addresses to different pages of
physical memory, so that each process has private user memory. Second,
each process sees its memory as having contiguous virtual addresses
starting at zero, while the process's physical memory can be
non-contiguous. Third, the kernel maps a page with trampoline code at
the top of the user address space (without `PTE_U`), thus a single page
of physical memory shows up in all address spaces, but can be used only
by the kernel.

![A process's user address space, with its initial
stack.](fig/processlayout.png){#fig:processlayout}

Code: exec
----------

Please read `kernel/exec.c` and `kernel/vm.c` starting at `uvmcreate()`.

`exec` is a system call that replaces a process's user address space
with data read from a file, called a binary or executable file. A binary
is typically the output of the compiler and linker, and holds machine
instructions and program data. `kexec`
[([6426]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L27), the
kernel's internal implementation of `exec`, opens the named binary
`path` using `namei`
[([6440]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L41),
which is explained in Chapter [10](#CH:FS){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:FS"}. Then, it reads the ELF header. Xv6 binaries are
formatted in the widely-used *ELF format*, defined in
[([0950]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/elf.h). An ELF
binary consists of an ELF header, `struct elfhdr`
[([0955]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/elf.h#L6),
followed by a sequence of program section headers, `struct proghdr`
[([0974]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/elf.h#L25). Each
`proghdr` describes a section of the application that must be loaded
into memory; xv6 programs have two program section headers: one for
instructions and one for data.

The first step is a quick check that the file probably contains an ELF
binary. An ELF binary starts with the four-byte "magic number" `0x7F`,
`` `E' ``, `` `L' ``, `` `F' ``, or `ELF_MAGIC`
[([0952]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/elf.h#L3). If the
ELF header has the right magic number, `kexec` assumes that the binary
is well-formed.

`kexec` allocates a new page table with no user mappings with
`proc_pagetable`
[([6454]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L55),
allocates memory for each ELF segment with `uvmalloc`
[([6470]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L71), and
loads each segment into memory with `loadseg`
[([6409]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L10).
`loadseg` uses `walkaddr` to find the physical address of the allocated
memory at which to write each page of the ELF segment, and `readi` to
read from the file.

The program section header for `/init`, the first user program created
with `exec`, looks like this:

    # objdump -p user/_init

    user/_init:     file format elf64-little

    Program Header:
    0x70000003 off    0x0000000000006bb0 vaddr 0x0000000000000000
                                           paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**0
             filesz 0x000000000000004a memsz 0x0000000000000000 flags r--
        LOAD off    0x0000000000001000 vaddr 0x0000000000000000
                                           paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**12
             filesz 0x0000000000001000 memsz 0x0000000000001000 flags r-x
        LOAD off    0x0000000000002000 vaddr 0x0000000000001000
                                           paddr 0x0000000000001000 align 2**12
             filesz 0x0000000000000010 memsz 0x0000000000000030 flags rw-
       STACK off    0x0000000000000000 vaddr 0x0000000000000000
                                           paddr 0x0000000000000000 align 2**4
             filesz 0x0000000000000000 memsz 0x0000000000000000 flags rw-

We see that the text segment should be loaded at virtual address 0x0 in
memory (without write permissions) from content at offset 0x1000 in the
file. We also see that the data should be loaded at address 0x1000,
which is at a page boundary, and without executable permissions.

A program section header's `filesz` may be less than the `memsz`,
indicating that the gap between them should be filled with zeroes (for C
global variables) rather than read from the file. For `/init`, the data
`filesz` is 0x10 bytes and `memsz` is 0x30 bytes, and thus `uvmalloc`
allocates enough physical memory to hold 0x30 bytes, but reads only 0x10
bytes from the file `/init`.

Now `kexec` allocates and initializes the user stack. It allocates just
one stack page. `kexec` copies the argument strings to the top of the
stack one at a time, recording the pointers to them in `ustack`. It
places a null pointer at the end of what will be the `argv` list passed
to `main`. The values for `argc` and `argv` are passed to `main` through
the system-call return path: `argc` is passed via the system call return
value, which goes in `a0`, and `argv` is passed through the `a1` entry
of the process's trapframe.

`kexec` places an inaccessible page just below the stack page, so that
programs that try to use more than one page will fault. This
inaccessible page also allows `kexec` to deal with arguments that are
too large; in that situation, the `copyout`
[([1754]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L343)
function that `kexec` uses to copy arguments to the stack will notice
that the destination page is not accessible, and will return -1.

During the preparation of the new memory image, if `kexec` detects an
error like an invalid program segment, it jumps to the label `bad`,
frees the new image, and returns -1. `kexec` must wait to free the old
image until it is sure that the system call will succeed: if the old
image is gone, the system call cannot return -1 to it. The only error
cases in `kexec` happen during the creation of the image. Once the image
is complete, `kexec` can commit to the new page table
[([6531]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L132) and
free the old one
[([6535]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/exec.c#L136).

The `exec` system call loads bytes from the ELF file into memory at
addresses specified by the ELF file. Users or processes can place
whatever addresses they want into an ELF file. Thus `exec` is risky,
because the addresses in the ELF file may refer to the kernel,
accidentally or on purpose. The consequences for an unwary kernel could
range from a crash to a malicious subversion of the kernel's isolation
mechanisms (i.e., a security exploit). Xv6 performs a number of checks
to avoid these risks. For example `if(ph.vaddr + ph.memsz < ph.vaddr)`
checks for whether the sum overflows a 64-bit integer. The danger is
that a user could construct an ELF binary with a `ph.vaddr` that points
to a user-chosen address, and `ph.memsz` large enough that the sum
overflows to 0x1000, which will look like a valid value. In an older
version of xv6 in which the user address space also contained the kernel
(but not readable/writable in user mode), the user could choose an
address that corresponded to kernel memory and would thus copy data from
the ELF binary into the kernel. In the RISC-V version of xv6 this cannot
happen, because the kernel has its own separate page table; `loadseg`
loads into the process's page table, not in the kernel's page table.

It is easy for a kernel developer to omit a crucial check, and
real-world kernels have a long history of missing checks whose absence
can be exploited by user programs to obtain kernel privileges. It is
likely that xv6 doesn't do a complete job of validating user-level data
supplied to the kernel, which a malicious user program might be able to
exploit to circumvent xv6's isolation.

Real world
----------

Like most operating systems, xv6 uses the paging hardware for memory
protection and mapping. Most operating systems make far more
sophisticated use of paging than xv6 by combining paging and page-fault
exceptions, which we will discuss in
Chapter [4](#CH:TRAP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:TRAP"}.

Xv6 is simplified by the kernel's use of a direct map between virtual
and physical addresses, and by its assumption that there is physical RAM
at address 0x80000000, where the kernel expects to be loaded. This works
with QEMU, but on real hardware it turns out to be a bad idea; real
hardware places RAM and devices at unpredictable physical addresses, so
that (for example) there might be no RAM at 0x80000000, where xv6 expect
to be able to store the kernel. More serious kernel designs exploit the
page table to turn arbitrary hardware physical memory layouts into
predictable kernel virtual address layouts.

RISC-V supports protection at the level of physical addresses, but xv6
doesn't use that feature.

On machines with lots of memory it might make sense to use RISC-V's
support for "super pages." Small pages make sense when physical memory
is small, to allow allocation and page-out to disk with fine
granularity. For example, if a program uses only 8 kilobytes of memory,
giving it a whole 4-megabyte super-page of physical memory is wasteful.
Larger pages make sense on machines with lots of RAM, and may reduce
overhead for page-table manipulation.

To avoid having to flush the complete TLB when changing page tables,
RISC-V CPUs may support address space identifiers (ASIDs) [@riscv:priv].
The kernel can then flush just the TLB entries for a particular address
space. Xv6 does not use this feature.

The xv6 kernel's lack of a `malloc`-like allocator that can provide
memory for small objects prevents the kernel from using sophisticated
data structures that would require dynamic allocation. A more elaborate
kernel would likely allocate many different sizes of small blocks,
rather than (as in xv6) just 4096-byte blocks; a real kernel allocator
would need to handle small allocations as well as large ones.

Memory allocation is a perennial hot topic, the basic problems being
efficient use of limited memory and preparing for unknown future
requests [@knuth]. Today people care more about speed than space
efficiency.

Exercises
---------

1.  Parse RISC-V's device tree to find the amount of physical memory the
    computer has.

2.  The functions `copyin` and `copyinstr` walk the user page table in
    software. Set up the kernel page table so that the kernel has the
    user program mapped, and `copyin` and ` copyinstr` can use `memcpy`
    to copy system call arguments into kernel space, relying on the
    hardware to do the page table walk.

3.  Modify xv6 to use super pages for the kernel.

4.  Unix implementations of `exec` traditionally include special
    handling for shell scripts. If the file to execute begins with the
    text `#!`, then the first line is taken to be a program to run to
    interpret the file. For example, if `exec` is called to run `myprog`
    `arg1` and `myprog` 's first line is `#!/interp`, then `exec` runs
    `/interp` with command line `/interp` `myprog` `arg1`. Implement
    support for this convention in xv6.

5.  Implement address space layout randomization for the kernel.

Traps and system calls {#CH:TRAP}
======================

There are three kinds of event which cause the CPU to set aside ordinary
execution of instructions and force a transfer of control to special
kernel code that handles the event. One situation is a system call, when
a user program executes the `ecall` instruction to ask the kernel to do
something for it. Another situation is an *exception*: an instruction
(user or kernel) does something illegal, such as load from an invalid
virtual address. The third situation is a device *interrupt*, when a
device signals that it needs attention, for example when the disk
hardware finishes a read or write request.

This book uses *trap* as a generic term for these situations. Typically
whatever code was executing at the time of the trap will later need to
resume, and shouldn't need to be aware that anything special happened.
That is, we often want traps to be transparent; this is particularly
important for device interrupts, which the interrupted code typically
doesn't expect. A trap forces a transfer of control into the kernel; the
kernel saves registers and other state so that execution can be resumed;
the kernel executes appropriate handler code (e.g., a system call
implementation or device driver); the kernel restores the saved state
and returns from the trap; and the original code resumes where it left
off.

Xv6 handles all traps in the kernel; traps are not delivered to user
code. Handling traps in the kernel is natural for system calls. It makes
sense for interrupts since isolation demands that only the kernel be
allowed to use devices, and because the kernel is able to share devices
among multiple processes. It also makes sense for exceptions since the
kernel may be able to handle the exception from user space (for an
example see Chapter [5](#CH:PGFAULTS){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:PGFAULTS"}) or respond by killing the offending program.

Xv6 trap handling proceeds in four stages: hardware actions taken by the
RISC-V CPU, some assembly instructions that prepare the way for kernel C
code, a C function that decides what to do with the trap, and the system
call or device-driver service routine. While commonality among the three
trap types suggests that a kernel could handle all traps with a single
code path, it turns out to be convenient to have separate code for two
distinct cases: traps from user space, and traps from kernel space.
Kernel code (assembler or C) that processes a trap is often called a
*handler*; the first handler instructions are usually written in
assembler (rather than C) and are sometimes called a *vector*.

Before proceeding, please read `kernel/trampoline.S`, and `usertrap()`
and `prepare_return()` in `kernel/trap.c`.

RISC-V trap machinery
---------------------

Each RISC-V CPU has a set of hardware control registers that the kernel
writes to tell the CPU how to handle traps, and that the kernel can read
to find out about a trap that has occurred. The RISC-V documents contain
the full story [@riscv:priv]. `riscv.h`
[([0500]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/riscv.h) contains
definitions that xv6 uses. Here's an outline of the most important
registers:

-   `stvec`: The kernel writes the address of its trap handler code
    here; the RISC-V jumps to the address in `stvec` to handle a trap.

-   `sepc`: When a trap occurs, RISC-V saves the program counter here
    (since the `pc` is then overwritten with the value in `stvec`). The
    `sret` (return from trap) instruction copies `sepc` to the `pc`. The
    kernel can write `sepc` to control where ` sret` goes.

-   `scause`: RISC-V puts a number here that describes the reason for
    the trap.

-   `sscratch`: The kernel trap handler code uses `sscratch` to help it
    avoid overwriting user registers before saving them.

-   `sstatus`: The SIE bit in `sstatus` controls whether device
    interrupts are enabled. If the kernel clears SIE, the RISC-V will
    defer device interrupts until the kernel sets SIE. The SPP bit
    indicates whether a trap came from user mode or supervisor mode, and
    controls to what mode `sret` returns.

The above registers can only be accessed in supervisor mode (i.e., by
the kernel); the CPU prevents user code from reading or writing them.

Each CPU on a multi-core chip has its own set of these registers, and
more than one CPU may be handling a trap at any given time.

When it forces a trap, the RISC-V hardware does the following:

1.  If the trap is a device interrupt, and the `sstatus` SIE bit is
    clear, don't do any of the following.

2.  Disable interrupts by clearing the SIE bit in `sstatus`.

3.  Copy the `pc` to `sepc`.

4.  Save the current mode (user or supervisor) in the SPP bit in
    `sstatus`.

5.  Set `scause` to a number indicating the trap's cause.

6.  Set the mode to supervisor.

7.  Copy `stvec` to the `pc`.

8.  Start executing at the new `pc`.

The CPU doesn't switch to the kernel page table, doesn't switch to a
stack in the kernel, and doesn't save any registers other than the `pc`.
Kernel software must perform these tasks. One reason that the CPU does
minimal work during a trap is to provide flexibility to software; for
example, some operating systems omit a page table switch in some
situations to increase trap performance.

It's worth thinking about whether any of the steps listed above could be
omitted, perhaps in search of faster traps. Though there are situations
in which a simpler sequence can work, many of the steps would be
dangerous to omit in general. For example, suppose that the CPU didn't
switch program counters. Then a trap from user space could switch to
supervisor mode while still running user instructions. Those user
instructions could break user/kernel isolation, for example by modifying
the `satp` register to point to a page table that allowed accessing all
of physical memory. It is thus important that the CPU switch to a
kernel-specified instruction address, namely ` stvec`.

Traps from user space
---------------------

Xv6 handles traps differently depending on whether the trap occurs while
executing in the kernel or in user code. Here is the story for traps
from user code; Section [4.5](#s:ktraps){reference-type="ref"
reference="s:ktraps"} describes traps from kernel code.

A trap may occur while executing in user space if the user program makes
a system call (`ecall` instruction), or does something illegal, or if a
device interrupts. As shown in
Figure [\[fig:usertrap\]](#fig:usertrap){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:usertrap"}, the high-level path of a trap from user space
is `uservec`
[([3071]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trampoline.S#L22),
then `usertrap`
[([3337]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L38); and
when the kernel is ready to return, `usertrap` returns to `userret`
[([3151]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trampoline.S#L101)
which executes `sret` to user space.

A major constraint on the design of xv6's trap handling is the fact that
the RISC-V hardware does not switch page tables when it forces a trap.
This means that the trap handler address in `stvec` must have a valid
mapping in the user page table, since that's the page table in force
when the trap handling code starts executing. Furthermore, xv6's trap
handling code needs to switch to the kernel page table; in order to be
able to continue executing after that switch, the kernel page table must
also have a mapping for the handler pointed to by `stvec`.

Xv6 satisfies these requirements using a *trampoline* page. This page
contains `uservec`, the xv6 trap handling code that `stvec` points to.
The trampoline page is mapped in every process's page table at virtual
address `0x3ffffff000` (called `TRAMPOLINE`), which is the last page in
the virtual address space so that it will be above memory that programs
use for themselves. The trampoline page is mapped at the same virtual
address in the kernel page table. See
Figure [2.2](#fig:as){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:as"} and
Figure [3.3](#fig:xv6_layout){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:xv6_layout"}. Because the trampoline page is mapped in
the user page table, traps can start executing there in supervisor mode.
Because the trampoline page is mapped at the same address in the kernel
address space, the trap handler can continue to execute after it
switches to the kernel page table.

The code for the `uservec` trap handler is in `trampoline.S`
[([3071]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trampoline.S#L22).
When `uservec` starts, all 32 registers contain values owned by the
interrupted user code. These 32 values need to be saved somewhere in
memory, so that later on the kernel can restore them before returning to
user space. Storing to memory requires use of a register to hold the
store's destination address, but at this point there are no
general-purpose registers available! Luckily RISC-V provides a helping
hand in the form of the `sscratch` register. The `csrw` instruction at
the start of `uservec` saves `a0` in ` sscratch`. Now `uservec` has one
register (`a0`) to play with.

`uservec`'s next task is to save the 32 user registers. The kernel
allocates, for each process, a page of memory for a `trapframe`
structure that (among other things) has space to save the 32 user
registers
[([1992]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.h#L43).
Because `satp` still refers to the user page table, `uservec` needs the
trapframe to be mapped in the user address space. Xv6 maps each
process's trapframe at virtual address `TRAPFRAME` (`0x3fffffe000`) in
that process's user page table; one page below `TRAMPOLINE`. Each
process's `p->trapframe` contains a kernel virtual address for the
process's trapframe.

`uservec` sets register `a0` to address `TRAPFRAME` and saves all the
user registers there. Then it retrieves the user `a0` from `sscratch`
and saves it in the trapframe.

The kernel previously initialized the trapframe to contain some values
useful to `uservec`: the address of the current process's kernel stack,
the current CPU's hartid, the address of the `usertrap` function, and
the address of the kernel page table. `uservec` retrieves these values,
switches `satp` to the kernel page table, and jumps to `usertrap`, a C
function.

The job of `usertrap` is to determine the cause of the trap, process it,
and return
[([3337]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L38). It
first changes `stvec` so that a trap while in the kernel will be handled
by `kernelvec` rather than `uservec`. It saves the `sepc` register (the
saved user program counter) for future use when returning back to user
space. If the trap is a system call, `usertrap` calls `syscall` to
handle it; if a device interrupt, `devintr`; if a page fault, `vmfault`;
otherwise it's an exception (e.g., use of an invalid address), and the
kernel kills the faulting process. The system call path adds four to the
saved user program counter because RISC-V, in the case of a system call,
leaves the program pointer pointing to the `ecall` instruction but user
code needs to resume executing at the subsequent instruction. `usertrap`
checks if the process has been killed or should yield the CPU (if this
trap is a timer interrupt).

The first step in returning to user space is the call to
`prepare_return`
[([3404]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L100).
This function sets up the RISC-V control registers to prepare for a
future trap from user space: setting `stvec` to `uservec` and preparing
the trapframe fields that `uservec` relies on. `prepare_return` sets
`sepc` to the previously saved user program counter. Finally, `usertrap`
returns back to `userret` in the trampoline page
[([3151]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trampoline.S#L101),
passing back a pointer to the user page table in `a0`.

`userret` switches `satp` to the process's user page table. Recall that
the user page table maps both the trampoline page and `TRAPFRAME`, but
nothing else from the kernel. The trampoline page mapping at the same
virtual address in user and kernel page tables allows `userret` to keep
executing after changing `satp`. From this point on, the only data
`userret` can use is the register contents and the content of the
trapframe. `userret` loads the `TRAPFRAME` address into `a0`, restores
saved user registers from the trapframe via `a0`, restores the saved
user `a0`, and executes `sret` to return to user space.

`uservec` and `userret` are written in assembly language because it is
difficult to write C code to save or restore all the registers or
survive switching page tables.

Code: Calling system calls
--------------------------

User programs call library functions in order to make system calls. For
example, the shell displays a prompt with this function call (in
`user/sh.c`):

      write(2, "$ ", 2);

Here's the library function, in `user/usys.S`:

    write:
     li a7, SYS_write
     ecall
     ret

The code that the C compiler generates for the function call loads the
three arguments into registers `a0`, `a1`, and `a2`. Then the `write()`
function loads the system call number, `SYS_write` (16), into `a7`. The
kernel will look at those registers to find out what system call is
intended, and what the arguments are. The `ecall` instruction traps from
user space into the kernel and causes `uservec`, `usertrap`, and then
`syscall` to execute.

At this point, please read `kernel/syscall.c`, `sys_write()` in
`kernel/sysfile.c`, and `copyout()`, `copyin()`, and `copyinstr()` in
`kernel/vm.c`.

`syscall`
[([3731]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/syscall.c#L132)
retrieves the system call number from the saved `a7` in the trapframe
and uses it to index into `syscalls`
[([3706]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/syscall.c#L107).
For our example, `a7` contains `SYS_write`
[([3566]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/syscall.h#L17),
resulting in a call to the system call implementation function
`sys_write`.

When `sys_write` returns, `syscall` records its return value in
`p->trapframe->a0`. This will cause the original user-space call to
`write()` to return that value, since the C calling convention on RISC-V
places return values in `a0`. System calls conventionally return
negative numbers to indicate errors, and zero or positive numbers for
success.

Code: System call arguments
---------------------------

System call arguments start out in the user registers, and are then
moved to the trap frame by the kernel trap code. The kernel functions
`argint`, `argaddr`, and `argfd` retrieve the *n* 'th system call
argument from the trap frame as an integer, pointer, or a file
descriptor.

Some system calls pass pointers as arguments, and the kernel must use
those pointers to read or write user memory. The `write` system call,
for example, passes the kernel a user-space pointer to the data to be
written. Such pointers pose two challenges. First, the user program may
be buggy or malicious, and may pass the kernel an invalid pointer or a
pointer intended to trick the kernel into accessing kernel memory
instead of user memory. Second, the xv6 kernel page table mappings are
not the same as the user page table mappings, so the kernel cannot use
ordinary instructions to load or store from user-supplied addresses.

The kernel implements functions that safely transfer data to and from
user-supplied addresses. `fetchstr` is an example
[([3624]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/syscall.c#L25).
File system calls such as `exec` use `fetchstr` to retrieve string
file-name arguments from user space. `fetchstr` calls `copyinstr` to do
the hard work.

`copyinstr`
[([1833]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L410) copies
up to `max` bytes to `dst` from virtual address `srcva` in the user page
table `pagetable`. Since `pagetable` is *not* the current page table,
`copyinstr` uses `walkaddr` (which calls `walk`) to look up `srcva` in
`pagetable`, yielding physical address `pa0`. The kernel's page table
maps all of physical RAM at virtual addresses that are equal to the
RAM's physical address. This allows `copyinstr` to directly copy string
bytes from `pa0` to `dst`. `walkaddr`
[([1520]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L121) checks
that the user-supplied virtual address is part of the process's user
address space, so programs cannot trick the kernel into reading other
memory. A similar function, `copyout`, copies data from the kernel to a
user-supplied address.

Traps from kernel space {#s:ktraps}
-----------------------

Please read `kernel/kernelvec.S`, and `kerneltrap()` in `kernel/trap.c`.

Xv6 handles traps from kernel code in a different way than traps from
user code. When entering the kernel, `usertrap` points `stvec` to the
assembly code at `kernelvec`
[([3211]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kernelvec.S#L12).
Since `kernelvec` only executes if xv6 was already in the kernel,
`kernelvec` can rely on `satp` being set to the kernel page table, and
on the stack pointer referring to a valid kernel stack. `kernelvec`
pushes all 32 registers onto the current stack, from which it will later
restore them so that the interrupted kernel code can resume without
disturbance.

`kernelvec` saves the registers on the stack of the interrupted kernel
thread, which makes sense because the register values belong to that
thread. This is particularly important if the trap causes a switch to a
different thread -- in that case the trap will actually return from the
stack of the new thread, leaving the interrupted thread's saved
registers safely on its stack.

`kernelvec` jumps to `kerneltrap`
[([3453]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L136)
after saving registers. `kerneltrap` is prepared for just one type of
trap: device interrupts. It calls `devintr`
[([3506]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L186) to
handle them. If the trap isn't a device interrupt, it must be an
exception, such as kernel code trying to use an invalid pointer. This
could only be caused by a bug in the kernel code. The kernel does not
have a way to recover in this situation, so it calls `panic()`, which
prints an error message and then halts.

If `kerneltrap` was called due to a timer interrupt, and a process's
kernel thread is running (as opposed to a scheduler thread),
`kerneltrap` calls `yield` to give other threads a chance to run. At
some point one of those threads will yield, and let our thread and its
`kerneltrap` resume again. Chapter [8](#CH:SCHED){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:SCHED"} explains what happens in `yield`.

When `kerneltrap`'s work is done, it needs to return to whatever code
was interrupted by the trap. Because a `yield` may have disturbed `sepc`
and the previous mode in `sstatus`, `kerneltrap` saves them when it
starts. It now restores those control registers and returns to
`kernelvec`
[([3237]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kernelvec.S#L38).
`kernelvec` pops the saved registers from the stack and executes `sret`,
which copies `sepc` to `pc` and resumes the interrupted kernel code.

Xv6 sets a CPU's `stvec` to `kernelvec` when that CPU enters the kernel
from user space; you can see this in `usertrap`
[([3346]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L47). But
there's a window of time when the kernel has started executing but
`stvec` is still set to `uservec`, and it's crucial that no device
interrupt occur during that window. Luckily the RISC-V always disables
interrupts when it starts to take a trap, and `usertrap` doesn't enable
them again until after it sets `stvec`.

Real world
----------

The need for trampoline pages could be eliminated if kernel memory were
mapped into every process's user page table (with `PTE_U` clear). That
would also eliminate the need for a page table switch when trapping from
user space into the kernel. That in turn would allow system call
implementations in the kernel to take advantage of the current process's
user memory being mapped, allowing kernel code to directly dereference
user pointers. Many operating systems have used these ideas to increase
efficiency. Xv6 avoids them in order to reduce the chances of security
bugs in the kernel due to inadvertent use of user pointers, and to
reduce some complexity that would be required to ensure that user and
kernel virtual addresses don't overlap.

Exercises
---------

1.  Could some or all of the code in `trampoline.S` and `kernelvec.S` be
    written in C rather than assembler?

2.  Is there a way to eliminate the special ` TRAPFRAME` page mapping in
    every user address space? For example, could `uservec` be modified
    to simply push the 32 user registers onto the kernel stack, or store
    them in the `proc` structure?

3.  Could xv6 be modified to eliminate the special ` TRAMPOLINE` page
    mapping?

Page faults {#CH:PGFAULTS}
===========

The RISC-V CPU raises a page-fault exception when a virtual address is
used that has no mapping in the page table, or has a mapping whose
`PTE_V` flag is clear, or a mapping whose permission bits (`PTE_R`,
`PTE_W`, `PTE_X`, `PTE_U`) forbid the operation being attempted. RISC-V
distinguishes three kinds of page fault: load page faults (caused by
load instructions), store page faults (caused by store instructions),
and instruction page faults (caused by fetches of instructions to be
executed). The `scause` register indicates the type of the page fault
and the `stval` register contains the address that couldn't be
translated.

The combination of page tables and page faults is a powerful tool. Page
tables give the kernel a level of indirection between virtual and
physical addresses, so that the kernel can control the structure and
content of address spaces. Page faults allow the kernel to intercept
loads and stores and, by modifying the page table, specify on the fly
what data those references refer to. The kernel can use these
capabilities to increase efficiency: for example, copy-on-write fork
allows the kernel to transparently share memory between parent and
child, avoiding the cost of copying pages that neither write.
Application programmers can also benefit. One possibility is
memory-mapped files, where the kernel uses paging to cause a file's
content to appear in an application's address space, transparently
reading file blocks in response to page faults. Another is lazy memory
allocation, which allows a program to ask for a huge virtual address
space, but only to pay the cost of allocating physical memory for the
pages the program actually reads and writes. xv6 uses page faults for
only one purpose: lazy allocation.

Before proceeding, please read the functions `sys_sbrk()` in
` kernel/sysproc.c`, and `vmfault` in `kernel/vm.c`. Search for calls to
`vmfault` in `kernel/trap.c` and ` kernel/vm.c`.

Lazy allocation {#sec:lazy}
---------------

xv6's *lazy allocation* has two parts. First, when an application asks
for memory by calling `sbrk` with the flag `SBRK_LAZY`, the kernel notes
the increase in size, but does not allocate physical memory and does not
create PTEs for the new range of virtual addresses. Second, on a page
fault on one of those new addresses, the kernel allocates a page of
physical memory and maps it into the page table. The kernel implements
lazy allocation transparently to applications: no modifications to
applications are necessary for them to benefit.

Lazy allocation is convenient for applications because they don't have
to accurately predict how much memory they will need. For example, an
application may process input, but not know in advance how large the
input will be. With lazy allocations an application can ask for memory
for the worst case, but not have to pay for this worst case: the kernel
doesn't have to do any work at all for pages that the application never
uses.

Furthermore, if the application is asking to grow the address space by a
lot, then `sbrk` without lazy allocation is expensive: if an application
asks for a gigabyte of memory, the kernel has to allocate and zero
262,144 4096-byte physical pages. Lazy allocation allows this cost to be
spread over time. On the other hand, lazy allocation incurs the extra
overhead of page faults, which involve a user/kernel transition.
Operating systems can reduce this cost by allocating a batch of
consecutive pages per page fault instead of one page and by specializing
the kernel entry/exit code for such page-faults (though xv6 does
neither).

On the other hand, when taking a page fault for a lazily-allocated page,
the kernel may find that it has not free memory to allocate. In this
case, the kernel has no easy way of returning an out-of-memory error to
the application and instead kills the application. For applications that
prefer an error on a failed allocation, xv6 allows an application to
allocate memory eagerly by calling `sbrk` with the flag `SBRK_EAGER`.

Code
----

The system call `sbrk(n)` grows (or shrinks if `n` is negative) a
process's memory size by `n` bytes, and returns the start of the newly
allocated region (i.e., the old size). The kernel implementation is
`sys_sbrk`
[([3801]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysproc.c#L40).

If the application specifies `SBRK_EAGER`, the system call is
implemented by the function `growproc`
[([2353]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L237).
`growproc` calls `uvmalloc`. `uvmalloc`
[([1628]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L217)
allocates physical memory with `kalloc`, zeros the allocated memory, and
adds PTEs to the user page table with `mappages`.

If the applications allocates memory lazily, `sys_sbrk` just increments
the process's size (`myproc()->sz`) by `n` and returns the old size; it
does not allocate physical memory or add PTEs to the process's page
table.

When a process loads or stores to a virtual address that lacks a valid
page-table mapping, the CPU will raise *page-fault exception*.
`usertrap` checks for this case
[([3372]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L73) and
calls `vmfault`
[([1879]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L453) to
handle the page fault. `vmfault` checks that the faulting address is
within the region previously granted by `sbrk`, allocates a page of
physical memory with `kalloc`, zeros the allocated page, and adds a PTE
to the user page table with `mappages`. Xv6 sets the `PTE_W`, `PTE_R`,
`PTE_U`, and `PTE_V` flags in the PTE for the new page. Then, `usertrap`
resumes the process at the instruction that caused the fault. Because
the PTE is now valid, the re-executed load or store instruction will
execute without a fault.

If an application frees memory using `sbrk`, `sys_sbrk` calls
`shrinkproc`, which calls `uvmdealloc`. The real work is done by
`uvmunmap`
[([1604]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/vm.c#L193), which
uses `walk` to find PTEs. Since some pages may never have been used by
the process and thus never have been allocated by ` vmfault`, `uvmunmap`
skips PTEs without the `PTE_V` flag. If a PTE mapping is valid,
`uvmunmap` calls `kfree` to free the physical memory it refers to.

Note that Xv6 uses a process's page table not just to tell the hardware
how to map user virtual addresses, but also as the only record of which
physical memory pages are allocated to that process. That is the reason
why freeing user memory (in ` uvmunmap`) requires examination of the
user page table.

Real world: Copy-On-Write (COW) fork
------------------------------------

Many kernels (though not xv6) use page faults to implement
*copy-on-write (COW) fork*. The `fork` system call promises that the
child sees memory whose initial content is the same as the parent's
memory at the time of the fork. One way to implement this is to copy the
entire memory of the parent to newly allocated physical memory for the
child; this is what xv6 does. Copying can be slow, and it would be more
efficient if the child could share the parent's physical memory. A
straightforward implementation of this would not work, however, since it
would cause the parent and child to disrupt each other's execution with
their writes to the shared stack and heap.

Copy-on-write fork causes parent and child to safely share physical
memory by appropriate use of page-table permissions and page faults. The
basic plan is for the parent and child to initially share all physical
pages, but for each to map them read-only (with the `PTE_W` flag clear).
Parent and child can then read from the shared physical memory. If
either writes a shared page, the RISC-V CPU raises a page-fault
exception. A kernel supporting COW would respond by allocating a new
page of physical memory and copying the shared page into that new page.
Then kernel would change the relevant PTE in the faulting process's page
table to point to the copy and to allow writes as well as reads, and
then resume the faulting process at the instruction that caused the
fault. Because the PTE now allows writes, the re-executed store
instruction will execute without a fault, and will modify a private copy
of the page rather than the shared page.

Copy-on-write requires book-keeping to help decide when physical pages
can be freed, since each page can be referenced by a varying number of
page tables depending on the history of forks, page faults, execs, and
exits. This book-keeping allows an important optimization: if a process
incurs a store page fault and the physical page is only referred to from
that process's page table, no copy is needed.

Copy-on-write makes `fork` faster, since `fork` need not copy memory.
Some of the memory will have to be copied later, when written, but it's
often the case that most of the memory never has to be copied. A common
example is `fork` followed by `exec`: a few pages may be written after
the `fork`, but then the child's `exec` releases the bulk of the memory
inherited from the parent. Copy-on-write `fork` eliminates the need to
ever copy this memory. Furthermore, COW fork is transparent: no
modifications to applications are necessary for them to benefit.

Real world: Demand paging
-------------------------

Yet another widely-used feature that exploits page faults is *demand
paging*. In the `exec` system call, xv6 loads all of an application's
text and data into memory before starting the application. Since
applications can be large and reading from disk takes time, this startup
cost can be noticeable to users. To decrease startup time, a modern
kernel doesn't initially load the executable file into memory, but just
creates the user page table with all PTEs marked invalid. The kernel
starts the program running; each time the program uses a page for the
first time, a page fault occurs, and in response the kernel reads the
content of the page from disk and maps it into the user address space.
Like COW fork and lazy allocation, the kernel can implement this feature
transparently to applications.

The programs running on a computer may need more memory than the
computer has RAM. To cope gracefully, the operating system may implement
*paging to disk*. The idea is to store only a fraction of user pages in
RAM, and to store the rest on disk in a *paging area*. The kernel marks
PTEs that correspond to memory stored in the paging area (and thus not
in RAM) as invalid. If an application tries to use one of the pages that
has been *paged out* to disk, the application will incur a page fault,
and the page must be *paged in*: the kernel trap handler will allocate a
page of physical RAM, read the page from disk into the RAM, and modify
the relevant PTE to point to the RAM.

What happens if a page needs to be paged in, but there is no free
physical RAM? In that case, the kernel must first free a physical page
by paging it out or *evicting* it to the paging area on disk, and
marking the PTEs referring to that physical page as invalid. Eviction is
expensive, so paging performs best if it's infrequent: if applications
use only a subset of their memory pages and the union of the subsets
fits in RAM. This property is often referred to as having good locality
of reference. As with many virtual memory techniques, kernels usually
implement paging to disk in a way that's transparent to applications.

Computers often operate with little or no *free* physical memory,
regardless of how much RAM the hardware provides. For example, cloud
providers multiplex many customers on a single machine to use their
hardware cost-effectively. As another example, users run many
applications on smart phones in a small amount of physical memory. In
such settings allocating a page may require first evicting an existing
page. Thus, when free physical memory is scarce, allocation is
expensive.

Lazy allocation and demand paging are particularly advantageous when
free memory is scarce and programs actively use only a fraction of their
allocated memory. These techniques can also avoid the work wasted when a
page is allocated or loaded but either never used or evicted before it
can be used.

Real world: Memory-mapped files
-------------------------------

Other features that combine paging and page-fault exceptions include
automatically extending stacks and *memory-mapped files*, which are
files that a program maps into its address space using the `mmap` system
call so that the program can read and write them using load and store
instructions.

Exercises
---------

1.  Write a user program that grows its address space by one byte by
    calling `sbrk(1)`. Run the program and investigate the page table
    for the program before the call to `sbrk` and after the call to
    `sbrk`. How much space has the kernel allocated? What does the PTE
    for the new memory contain?

2.  Implement COW fork.

3.  Implement `mmap`.

Interrupts and device drivers {#CH:INTERRUPT}
=============================

A *driver* is the code in an operating system that manages a particular
device: it configures the device hardware, tells the device to perform
operations, handles the resulting interrupts, and interacts with
processes using the device. Driver code can be tricky because a driver
executes concurrently with the device, and often concurrently with
processes using the device. In addition, the driver must understand the
device's hardware interface, which can be complex and poorly documented.

Devices that need attention from the operating system can usually be
configured to generate interrupts, which are one type of trap. The
kernel trap handling code recognizes when a device has raised an
interrupt and calls the driver's interrupt handler; in xv6, this
dispatch happens in `devintr`
[([3506]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L186).

Many device drivers execute code in two contexts: a *top half* that runs
in a process's kernel thread, and a *bottom half* that executes at
interrupt time. The top half is called via system calls such as `read`
and `write` that want the device to perform I/O. This code may ask the
hardware to start an operation (e.g., ask the disk to read a block);
then the code waits for the operation to complete. Eventually the device
completes the operation and raises an interrupt. The driver's interrupt
handler, acting as the bottom half, figures out what operation has
completed, wakes up a waiting process if appropriate, and tells the
hardware to start work on the next operation, if any.

Code: Console input
-------------------

The console driver
[([6950]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c) is a
simple illustration of driver structure. The console driver accepts
characters typed by a human, via the *UART* serial-port hardware
attached to the RISC-V. The console driver accumulates a line of input
at a time, processing special input characters such as backspace and
control-u. User processes, such as the shell, use the `read` system call
to fetch lines of input from the console. When you type input to xv6 in
QEMU, your keystrokes are delivered to xv6 by way of QEMU's simulated
UART hardware.

The UART hardware that the driver talks to is a 16550 chip [@ns16550a]
emulated by QEMU. On a real computer, a 16550 would manage an RS232
serial link connecting to a terminal or other computer. When running
QEMU, it's connected to your keyboard and display.

The UART hardware appears to software as a set of *memory-mapped*
control registers. That is, there are some physical addresses that are
connected to the UART device, so that loads and stores interact with the
device hardware rather than RAM. The memory-mapped addresses for the
UART start at 0x10000000, or `UART0`
[([0220]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/memlayout.h#L21).
There are a handful of UART control registers, each the width of a byte.
Their offsets from `UART0` are defined in
[([7223]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/uart.c#L24). For
example, the `LSR` register contains bits that indicate whether input
characters are waiting to be read by the driver. These characters (if
any) are available for reading from the `RHR` register. Each time one is
read, the UART hardware deletes it from an internal FIFO of waiting
characters, and clears the "ready" bit in `LSR` when the FIFO is empty.
To transmit, the driver writes a byte to the `THR` register, which
causes the UART to append the byte to a FIFO of bytes that the UART will
send on the RS232 serial link. The UART transmit and receive hardware
are largely independent of each other.

Xv6's `main` calls `consoleinit`
[([7154]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c#L188)
to initialize the UART hardware. This code configures the UART to
generate a receive interrupt when the UART receives each byte of input,
and a *transmit complete* interrupt each time the UART finishes sending
a byte of output
[([7251]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/uart.c#L49).

The xv6 shell reads from the console by way of a file descriptor opened
by `init.c`
[([7768]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/user/init.c#L19). Calls
to the `read` system call make their way through the kernel to
` consoleread`
[([7041]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c#L86).
` consoleread` waits for input to arrive (via interrupts) and be
buffered in `cons.buf`, copies the input to user space, and (after a
whole line has arrived) returns to the user process. If the user hasn't
typed a full line yet, any reading processes will wait in the `sleep`
call
[([7057]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c#L102)
(Chapter [9](#CH:SLEEP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:SLEEP"}
explains the details of `sleep`).

When the user types a character, the UART hardware asks the RISC-V to
raise an interrupt, which activates xv6's trap handler. The trap handler
calls `devintr`
[([3506]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L186),
which looks at the RISC-V `scause` register to discover that the
interrupt is from an external device. Then it asks a hardware unit
called the PLIC [@riscv:priv] to tell it which device interrupted
[([3514]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L194). If
it was the UART, `devintr` calls `uartintr`.

`uartintr`
[([7354]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/uart.c#L142)
reads any waiting input characters from the UART hardware and hands them
to `consoleintr`
[([7107]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c#L142);
it doesn't wait for characters, since future input will raise a new
interrupt. The job of `consoleintr` is to accumulate input characters in
`cons.buf` until a whole line arrives. `consoleintr` treats backspace
and a few other characters specially. When a newline arrives,
`consoleintr` wakes up a waiting `consoleread` (if there is one).

Once woken, `consoleread` will observe a full line in ` cons.buf`, copy
it to user space, and return (via the system call machinery) to user
space.

Code: Console output
--------------------

A `write` system call on a file descriptor connected to the console
eventually arrives at `uartputc`
[([7309]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/uart.c#L106). The
device driver maintains an output buffer (`uart_tx_buf`) so that writing
processes do not have to wait for the UART to finish sending; instead,
`uartputc` appends each character to the buffer, calls `uartstart` to
start the device transmitting (if it isn't already), and returns. The
only situation in which `uartputc` waits is if the buffer is already
full.

Each time the UART finishes sending a byte, it generates an interrupt.
`uartintr` calls `uartstart`, which checks that the device really has
finished sending, and hands the device the next buffered output
character. Thus if a process writes multiple bytes to the console,
typically the first byte will be sent by `uartputc`'s call to
`uartstart`, and the remaining buffered bytes will be sent by
`uartstart` calls from `uartintr` as transmit complete interrupts
arrive.

A general pattern to note is the decoupling of device activity from
process activity via buffering and interrupts. The console driver can
process input even when no process is waiting to read it; a subsequent
read will see the input. Similarly, processes can send output without
having to wait for the device. This decoupling can increase performance
by allowing processes to execute concurrently with device I/O, and is
particularly important when the device is slow (as with the UART) or
needs immediate attention (as with echoing typed characters). This idea
is sometimes called *I/O concurrency*.

Concurrency in drivers
----------------------

You may have noticed calls to `acquire` in `consoleread` and in
`consoleintr`. These calls acquire a lock, which protects the console
driver's data structures from concurrent access. There are three
concurrency dangers here: two processes on different CPUs might call
`consoleread` at the same time; the hardware might ask a CPU to deliver
a console (really UART) interrupt while that CPU is already executing
inside `consoleread`; and the hardware might deliver a console interrupt
on a different CPU while `consoleread` is executing.
Chapter [7](#CH:LOCK){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:LOCK"} explains
how to use locks to ensure that these dangers don't lead to incorrect
results.

Another way in which concurrency requires care in drivers is that one
process may be waiting for input from a device, but the interrupt
signaling arrival of the input may arrive when a different process (or
no process at all) is running. Thus interrupt handlers are not allowed
to think about the process or code that they have interrupted. For
example, an interrupt handler cannot safely call `copyout` with the
current process's page table. Interrupt handlers typically do relatively
little work (e.g., just copy the input data to a buffer), and wake up
top-half code to do the rest.

Timer interrupts
----------------

Xv6 uses timer interrupts to maintain its idea of the current time and
to switch among compute-bound processes. Timer interrupts come from
clock hardware attached to each RISC-V CPU. Xv6 programs each CPU's
clock hardware to interrupt the CPU periodically.

Code in `start.c`
[([1102]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/start.c#L53) sets
some control bits that allow supervisor-mode access to the timer control
registers, and then asks for the first timer interrupt. The `time`
control register contains a count that the hardware increments at a
steady rate; this serves as a notion of the current time. The `stimecmp`
register contains a time at which the the CPU will raise a timer
interrupt; setting `stimecmp` to the current value of `time` plus *x*
will schedule an interrupt *x* time units in the future. For `qemu`'s
RISC-V emulation, 1000000 time units is roughly a tenth of second.

Timer interrupts arrive via `usertrap` or `kerneltrap` and `devintr`,
like other device interrupts. Timer interrupts arrive with `scause`'s
low bits set to five; `devintr` in `trap.c` detects this situation and
calls `clockintr`
[([3482]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L165). The
latter function increments `ticks`, allowing the kernel to track the
passage of time. The increment occurs on only one CPU, to avoid time
passing faster if there are multiple CPUs. `clockintr` wakes up any
processes waiting in the `pause` system call, and schedules the next
timer interrupt by writing `stimecmp`.

`devintr` returns 2 for a timer interrupt in order to indicate to
`kerneltrap` or `usertrap` that they should call `yield` so that CPUs
can be multiplexed among runnable processes.

The fact that kernel code can be interrupted by a timer interrupt that
forces a context switch via `yield` is part of the reason why early code
in `usertrap` is careful to save state such as ` sepc` before enabling
interrupts. These context switches also mean that kernel code must be
written in the knowledge that it may move from one CPU to another
without warning.

Real world
----------

Xv6, like many operating systems, allows interrupts and even context
switches (via `yield`) while executing in the kernel. The reason for
this is to retain quick response times during complex system calls that
run for a long time. However, as noted above, allowing interrupts in the
kernel is the source of some complexity; as a result, a few operating
systems allow interrupts only while executing user code.

Supporting all the devices on a typical computer in its full glory is
much work, because there are many devices, the devices have many
features, and the protocol between device and driver can be complex and
poorly documented. In many operating systems, the drivers account for
more code than the core kernel.

The UART driver retrieves data a byte at a time by reading the UART
control registers; this pattern is called *programmed I/O*, since
software is driving the data movement. Programmed I/O is simple, but too
slow to be used at high data rates. Devices that need to move lots of
data at high speed typically use *direct memory access (DMA)*. DMA
device hardware directly writes incoming data to RAM, and reads outgoing
data from RAM. Modern disk and network devices use DMA. A driver for a
DMA device would prepare data in RAM, and then use a single write to a
control register to tell the device to process the prepared data.

Interrupts make sense when a device needs attention at unpredictable
times, and not too often. But interrupts have high CPU overhead. Thus
high speed devices, such as network and disk controllers, use tricks
that reduce the need for interrupts. One trick is to raise a single
interrupt for a whole batch of incoming or outgoing requests. Another
trick is for the driver to disable interrupts entirely, and to check the
device periodically to see if it needs attention. This technique is
called *polling*. Polling makes sense if the device performs operations
at a high rate, but it wastes CPU time if the device is mostly idle.
Some drivers dynamically switch between polling and interrupts depending
on the current device load.

The UART driver copies incoming data first to a buffer in the kernel,
and then to user space. This makes sense at low data rates, but such a
double copy can significantly reduce performance for devices that
generate or consume data very quickly. Some operating systems are able
to directly move data between user-space buffers and device hardware,
often with DMA.

As mentioned in Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:UNIX"}, the console appears to applications as a regular
file, and applications read input and write output using the `read` and
`write` system calls. Applications may want to control aspects of a
device that cannot be expressed through the standard file system calls
(e.g., enabling/disabling line buffering in the console driver). Unix
operating systems provide an `ioctl` system call for such cases.

Some uses of computers require "real-time" responses to external events:
responses guaranteed to occur within a bounded time. For example, in
safety-critical systems missing a deadline can lead to disasters. Xv6 is
not suitable for real-time settings. Among other things, xv6's scheduler
does not take into account real-time deadlines when it decides what
process to run next, and xv6 has long kernel code paths with interrupts
disabled, so that it may not respond to interrupts quickly. A real-time
operating system must not only fix these problems, but also be
structured in a way that allows analysis of worst-case response times.

Locking {#CH:LOCK}
=======

Most kernels, including xv6, interleave the execution of multiple
activities. One source of interleaving is multiprocessor hardware:
computers with multiple CPUs executing independently, such as xv6's
RISC-V. These multiple CPUs share physical RAM, and xv6 exploits the
sharing to maintain kernel data structures that all CPUs read and write.
This sharing raises the possibility of one CPU reading a data structure
while another CPU is mid-way through updating it, or even multiple CPUs
updating the same data simultaneously; without careful design such
parallel access is likely to yield incorrect results or a broken data
structure. Even on a uniprocessor, the kernel may switch the CPU among a
number of threads, causing their execution to be interleaved. Finally, a
device interrupt handler that modifies the same data as some
interruptible code could damage the data if the interrupt occurs at just
the wrong time. The word *concurrency* refers to situations in which
multiple instruction streams are interleaved, due to multiprocessor
parallelism, thread switching, or interrupts.

Kernels are full of concurrently-accessed data. For example, two CPUs
could simultaneously call `kalloc`, thereby concurrently popping from
the head of the free list. Kernel designers like to allow for lots of
concurrency, since it can yield increased performance through
parallelism, and increased responsiveness. However, as a result kernel
designers must convince themselves of correctness despite such
concurrency. There are many ways to arrive at correct code, some easier
to reason about than others. Strategies aimed at correctness under
concurrency, and abstractions that support them, are called *concurrency
control* techniques.

Xv6 uses a number of concurrency control techniques, depending on the
situation; many more are possible. This chapter focuses on a widely used
technique: the *lock*. A lock provides mutual exclusion, ensuring that
only one CPU at a time can hold the lock. If the programmer associates a
lock with each shared data item, and the code always holds the
associated lock when using an item, then the item will be used by only
one CPU at a time. In this situation, we say that the lock protects the
data item. Although locks are an easy-to-understand concurrency control
mechanism, the downside of locks is that they can limit performance,
because they serialize concurrent operations.

The rest of this chapter explains why xv6 needs locks, how xv6
implements them, and how it uses them.

Races
-----

![Simplified SMP architecture](fig/smp.pdf){#fig:smp}

As an example of why we need locks, consider two processes with exited
children calling the `wait` system call on two different CPUs. `wait`
frees the child's memory. Thus on each CPU, the kernel will call `kfree`
to free the children's memory pages. The kernel allocator maintains a
linked list of free pages: `kalloc()`
[([3027]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L69)
pops a page of memory from the list, and `kfree()`
[([3005]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L47)
pushes a page onto the list. For best performance, we might hope that
the `kfree`s of the two parent processes would execute in parallel
without either having to wait for the other, but this would not be
correct given xv6's `kfree` implementation.

Figure [7.1](#fig:smp){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:smp"}
illustrates the setting in more detail: the linked list of free pages is
in memory that is shared by the two CPUs, which manipulate the list
using load and store instructions. (In reality, the processors have
caches, but conceptually multiprocessor systems behave as if there were
a single, shared memory.) If there were no concurrent requests, you
might implement a list `push` operation as follows:

``` {.numberLines numbers="left" startFrom="1"}
struct element {
      int data;
      struct element *next;
    };
    
    struct element *list = 0;
    
    void
    push(int data)
    {
      struct element *l;
   
      l = malloc(sizeof *l);
      l->data = data;
      l->next = list; (*@\label{line:next}@*)
      list = l;  (*@\label{line:list}@*)
   }
```

![Example race](fig/race.pdf){#fig:race}

This implementation is correct if executed in isolation. However, the
code is not correct if more than one copy executes concurrently. If two
CPUs execute `push` at the same time, both might execute
line [\[line:next\]](#line:next){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:next"} as shown in
Fig [7.1](#fig:smp){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:smp"}, before
either executes line [\[line:list\]](#line:list){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:list"}, which results in an incorrect outcome as
illustrated by Figure [7.2](#fig:race){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:race"}. There would then be two list elements with `next`
set to the same former value of `list`. When the two assignments to
`list` happen at line  [\[line:list\]](#line:list){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:list"}, the second one will overwrite the first; the
element involved in the first assignment will be lost.

The lost update at line [\[line:list\]](#line:list){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:list"} is an example of a *race*. A race is a situation
in which a memory location is accessed concurrently, and at least one
access is a write. A race is often a sign of a bug, either a lost update
(if the accesses are writes) or a read of an incompletely-updated data
structure. The outcome of a race depends on the machine code generated
by the compiler, the timing of the two CPUs involved, and how their
memory operations are ordered by the memory system, which can make
race-induced errors difficult to reproduce and debug. For example,
adding print statements while debugging `push` might change the timing
of the execution enough to make the race disappear.

The usual way to avoid races is to use a lock. Locks ensure *mutual
exclusion*, so that only one CPU at a time can execute the sensitive
lines of `push`; this makes the scenario above impossible. The correctly
locked version of the above code adds just a few lines (highlighted in
yellow):

``` {.numberLines numbers="left" startFrom="6"}
struct element *list = 0;
   (*@\hl{struct lock listlock;}@*)
    	
   void
   push(int data)
   {
     struct element *l;
     l = malloc(sizeof *l); (*@\label{line:malloc}@*)
     l->data = data;
   
     (*@\hl{acquire(\&listlock);} @*)
     l->next = list;     (*@\label{line:next1}@*)
     list = l;           (*@\label{line:list1}@*)
     (*@\hl{release(\&listlock)}; @*)
   }
```

The sequence of instructions between `acquire` and `release` is often
called a *critical section*. The lock is said to be protecting `list`.

When we say that a lock protects data, we really mean that the lock
protects some collection of invariants that apply to the data.
Invariants are properties of data structures that are maintained across
operations. Typically, an operation's correct behavior depends on the
invariants being true when the operation begins. The operation may
temporarily violate the invariants but must reestablish them before
finishing. For example, in the linked list case, the invariant is that
`list` points at the first element in the list and that each element's
`next` field points at the next element. The implementation of `push`
violates this invariant temporarily: in
line [\[line:next1\]](#line:next1){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:next1"}, `l` points to the next list element, but `list`
does not point at `l` yet (reestablished at
line [\[line:list1\]](#line:list1){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:list1"}). The race we examined above happened because a
second CPU executed code that depended on the list invariants while they
were (temporarily) violated. Proper use of a lock ensures that only one
CPU at a time can operate on the data structure in the critical section,
so that no CPU will execute a data structure operation when the data
structure's invariants do not hold.

You can think of a lock as *serializing* concurrent critical sections so
that they run one at a time, and thus preserve invariants (assuming the
critical sections are correct in isolation). You can also think of
critical sections guarded by the same lock as being atomic with respect
to each other, so that each sees only the complete set of changes from
earlier critical sections, and never sees partially-completed updates.

Though useful for correctness, locks inherently limit performance. For
example, if two processes call `kfree` concurrently, the locks will
serialize the two critical sections, so that there is no benefit from
running them on different CPUs. We say that multiple processes
*conflict* if they want the same lock at the same time, or that the lock
experiences *contention*. A major challenge in kernel design is
avoidance of lock contention in pursuit of parallelism. Xv6 does little
of that, but sophisticated kernels organize data structures and
algorithms specifically to avoid lock contention. In the list example, a
kernel may maintain a separate free list per CPU and only touch another
CPU's free list if the current CPU's list is empty and it must steal
memory from another CPU. Other use cases may require more complicated
designs.

The placement of locks is also important for performance. For example,
it would be correct to move `acquire` earlier in `push`, before
line [\[line:malloc\]](#line:malloc){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:malloc"}. But this would likely reduce performance
because then the calls to `malloc` would be serialized. The section
"Using locks" below provides some guidelines for where to insert
`acquire` and `release` invocations.

Code: Locks
-----------

Please read `kernel/spinlock.h` and `kernel/spinlock.c`.

Xv6 has two types of locks: spinlocks and sleep-locks. We'll start with
spinlocks. Xv6 represents a spinlock as a `struct spinlock`
[([1201]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.h#L2).
The important field in the structure is `locked`, a word that is zero
when the lock is available and non-zero when it is held. Logically, xv6
should acquire a lock by executing code like

``` {.numberLines numbers="left" startFrom="21"}
void
   acquire(struct spinlock *lk) // does not work!
   {
     for(;;) {
       if(lk->locked == 0) {  (*@\label{line:testlocked}@*)
         lk->locked = 1;      (*@\label{line:assign}@*)
         break;
       }
     }
   }
```

Unfortunately, this implementation does not guarantee mutual exclusion
on a multiprocessor. It could happen that two CPUs simultaneously reach
line [\[line:testlocked\]](#line:testlocked){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:testlocked"}, see that `lk->locked` is zero, and then
both grab the lock by executing
line [\[line:assign\]](#line:assign){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:assign"}. At this point, two different CPUs hold the
lock, which violates the mutual exclusion property. What we need is a
way to make lines
[\[line:testlocked\]](#line:testlocked){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:testlocked"} and
[\[line:assign\]](#line:assign){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:assign"} execute as an *atomic* (i.e., indivisible)
step.

Because locks are widely used, multi-core processors usually provide an
instruction that can be used to make
lines [\[line:testlocked\]](#line:testlocked){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:testlocked"} and
[\[line:assign\]](#line:assign){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:assign"} atomic. On the RISC-V this instruction is
`amoswap r, a`. `amoswap` reads the value at the memory address `a`,
writes the contents of register `r` to that address, and puts the value
it read into `r`. That is, it swaps the contents of the register and the
addressed memory location. It performs this sequence atomically, using
special hardware to prevent any other CPU from using the memory address
between the read and the write.

The portable C library call `__sync_lock_test_and_set(addr, value)`
boils down to the `amoswap` instruction; the function returns the old
(swapped) contents of `addr`. Here's a good way to write the loop in
`acquire`:

``` {.numberLines numbers="left" startFrom="21"}
while(__sync_lock_test_and_set(&lk->locked, 1) != 0)
    ;
```

Xv6's `acquire`
[([1271]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L22)
uses the above loop. Each iteration swaps one into `lk->locked` and
checks the previous value; if the previous value is zero, then we've
acquired the lock, and the swap will have set `lk->locked` to one. If
the previous value is one, then some other CPU holds the lock, and the
fact that we atomically swapped one into `lk->locked` didn't change its
value.

Once the lock is acquired, `acquire` records, for debugging, the CPU
that acquired the lock. The `lk->cpu` field is protected by the lock and
must only be changed while holding the lock.

The function `release`
[([1302]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L47)
is the opposite of `acquire`: it clears the `lk->cpu` field and then
releases the lock. Conceptually, the release just requires assigning
zero to `lk->locked`. The C standard allows compilers to implement an
assignment with multiple store instructions, so a C assignment might be
non-atomic with respect to concurrent code. Instead, `release` uses the
C library function `__sync_lock_release` that performs an atomic
assignment. This function also boils down to a RISC-V `amoswap`
instruction.

Code: Using locks
-----------------

Xv6 uses locks in many places to avoid races. As described above,
`kalloc`
[([3027]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L69) and
`kfree`
[([3005]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L47)
form a good example. Try Exercises 1 and 2 to see what happens if those
functions omit the locks. You'll likely find that it's difficult to
trigger incorrect behavior, suggesting that it's hard to reliably test
whether code is free from locking errors and races. Xv6 may well have
as-yet-undiscovered races.

A hard part about using locks is deciding how many locks to use and
which data and invariants each lock should protect. There are a few
basic principles. First, any time a variable can be written by one CPU
at the same time that another CPU can read or write it, a lock should be
used to keep the two operations from overlapping. Second, remember that
locks protect invariants: if an invariant involves multiple memory
locations, typically all of them need to be protected by a single lock
to ensure the invariant is maintained.

The rules above say when locks are necessary but say nothing about when
locks are unnecessary, and it is important for efficiency not to lock
too much, because locks reduce parallelism. If parallelism isn't
important, then one could arrange to have only a single thread and not
worry about locks. A simple kernel can do this on a multiprocessor by
having a single lock; the kernel acquires the lock every time the kernel
is entered from user space, for a system call or interrupt; the kernel
releases the lock when it returns to user space. Many uniprocessor
operating systems have been converted to run on multiprocessors using
this approach, sometimes called a "big kernel lock," but the approach
sacrifices parallelism: only one CPU can execute in the kernel at a
time. If the kernel consumes significant CPU time, more parallelism
could be obtained by protecting different objects or modules with
different locks, so that different CPUs could be executing in different
parts of the kernel at the same time.

As an example of coarse-grained locking, xv6's `kalloc.c` allocator has
a single free list protected by a single lock. If multiple processes on
different CPUs try to allocate pages at the same time, each will have to
wait for its turn by spinning in ` acquire`. Spinning wastes CPU time,
since it's not useful work. If contention for the lock wasted a
significant fraction of CPU time, perhaps performance could be improved
by changing the allocator to have a separate free list per CPU, each
with its own lock, to allow truly parallel allocation.

As an example of fine-grained locking, xv6 has a separate lock for each
file, so that processes that manipulate different files can often
proceed without waiting for each other's locks. The file locking scheme
could be made even more fine-grained if one wanted to allow processes to
simultaneously write different areas of the same file. Ultimately lock
granularity decisions need to be driven by performance measurements as
well as complexity considerations.

As subsequent chapters explain each part of xv6, they will mention
examples of xv6's use of locks to deal with concurrency. As a preview,
Figure [\[fig:locktable\]](#fig:locktable){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:locktable"} lists all of the locks in xv6.

Deadlock and lock ordering
--------------------------

Suppose the functions running on CPUs C1 and C2 both have a point at
which each needs to hold both lock A and lock B, and they acquire them
in different orders:

With a bit of bad luck, C1 and C2 might both execute their first acquire
at exactly the same moment; both can succeed, since they are asking for
different locks. But then both C1 and C2 will have to wait in their
second calls to `acquire()`, since both locks are already held by the
other CPU. Because both CPUs are waiting for each other, neither will
ever release a lock, and both will wait forever. This situation is
called *deadlock*.

The key problem in the C1/C2 example is that the two CPUs acquired the
locks in different orders. If they had both tried to acquire A first,
one would have acquired A and then B and then released them both, and
then the other CPU could have proceeded. More generally, locking code
must follow this rule to avoid deadlock: all code paths that hold
multiple locks must acquire locks in the same order. The need for this
global lock acquisition order means that locks are effectively part of
each function's specification: callers must invoke functions in a way
that causes locks to be acquired in the agreed-on order.

Xv6 has many lock-order chains of length two involving per-process locks
(the lock in each `struct proc`) due to the way that `sleep` works (see
Chapter [9](#CH:SLEEP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:SLEEP"}). For
example, `consoleintr`
[([7107]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/console.c#L142)
is the interrupt routine which handles typed characters. When a newline
arrives, any process that is waiting for console input should be woken
up. To do this, `consoleintr` holds `cons.lock` while calling `wakeup`,
which acquires the waiting process's lock in order to wake it up. In
consequence, the global deadlock-avoiding lock order includes the rule
that `cons.lock` must be acquired before any process lock. The
file-system code contains xv6's longest lock chains. For example,
creating a file requires simultaneously holding a lock on the directory,
a lock on the new file's inode, a lock on a disk block buffer, the disk
driver's `vdisk_lock`, and the calling process's `p->lock`. To avoid
deadlock, file-system code always acquires locks in the order mentioned
in the previous sentence.

Honoring a global deadlock-avoiding order can be surprisingly difficult.
Sometimes the lock order conflicts with logical program structure, e.g.,
perhaps code module M1 calls module M2, but the lock order requires that
a lock in M2 be acquired before a lock in M1. Sometimes the identities
of locks aren't known in advance, perhaps because one lock must be held
in order to discover the identity of the lock to be acquired next. This
kind of situation arises in the file system as it looks up successive
components in a path name, and in the code for the `wait` and `exit`
system calls as they search the table of processes looking for child
processes. Finally, the danger of deadlock is often a constraint on how
fine-grained one can make a locking scheme, since more locks often means
more opportunity for deadlock. The need to avoid deadlock is often a
major factor in kernel implementation.

A question that sometimes arises is what should happen if a CPU tries to
acquire a lock that the same CPU already holds. One line of reasoning is
that this should be allowed: no other CPU can hold the lock, so there's
no need to worry about CPUs interfering with each others' use of the
protected data. Locking systems that allow a CPU to re-aquire a lock it
alread holds are called a *re-entrant* or *recursive*. On the other
hand, if a lock is already held, even on the same CPU, that means an
operation may have temporarily violated and not yet restored some
invariants; to allow a new operation to commence while the invariants
don't hold seems like an invitation to bugs. Xv6 takes this latter view,
and forbids a CPU that currently holds a lock from re-acquiring it.
Detecting this situation is the purpose of the call to `holding` in
`acquire`.

Locks and interrupts {#s:lockinter}
--------------------

Some xv6 spinlocks protect data that is used by both threads and
interrupt handlers. For example, the `clockintr` timer interrupt handler
might increment `ticks`
[([3482]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trap.c#L165) at
about the same time that a kernel thread reads `ticks` in `sys_pause`
[([3838]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysproc.c#L77).
The lock `tickslock` serializes the two accesses.

The interaction of spinlocks and interrupts raises a potential danger.
Suppose `sys_pause` holds `tickslock`, and its CPU is interrupted by a
timer interrupt. `clockintr` would try to acquire `tickslock`, see it
was held, and wait for it to be released. In this situation, `tickslock`
will never be released: only `sys_pause` can release it, but `sys_pause`
will not continue running until `clockintr` returns. So the CPU will
deadlock, and any code that needs either lock will also freeze.

To avoid this situation, if a spinlock is used by an interrupt handler,
a CPU must never hold that lock with interrupts enabled. Xv6 is more
conservative: when a CPU acquires any lock, xv6 always disables
interrupts on that CPU. Interrupts may still occur on other CPUs, so an
interrupt's `acquire` can wait for a thread to release a spinlock; just
not on the same CPU.

Xv6 re-enables interrupts when a CPU holds no spinlocks; it must do a
little book-keeping to cope with nested critical sections. `acquire`
calls `push_off`
[([1355]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L89)
and `release` calls `pop_off`
[([1369]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L103)
to track the nesting level of locks on the current CPU. When that count
reaches zero, `pop_off` restores the interrupt enable state that existed
at the start of the outermost critical section. The `intr_off` and
`intr_on` functions execute RISC-V instructions to disable and enable
interrupts, respectively.

It is important that `acquire` call `push_off` strictly before setting
`lk->locked`
[([1277]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L28).
If the two were reversed, there would be a brief window when the lock
was held with interrupts enabled, and an unfortunately timed interrupt
would deadlock the system. Similarly, it is important that `release`
call `pop_off` only after releasing the lock
[([1321]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L66).

Instruction and memory ordering
-------------------------------

It is natural to think of programs executing in the order in which
source code statements appear. That's a reasonable mental model for
single-threaded code, but is incorrect when multiple threads interact
through shared memory [@riscv:user; @boehm04]. One reason is that
compilers emit load and store instructions in orders different from
those implied by the source code, and may entirely omit them (for
example by caching data in registers). Another reason is that the CPU
may execute instructions out of order to increase performance. For
example, a CPU may notice that in a serial sequence of instructions A
and B are not dependent on each other. The CPU may start instruction B
first, either because its inputs are ready before A's inputs, or in
order to overlap execution of A and B.

As an example of what could go wrong, in this code for `push`, it would
be a disaster if the compiler or CPU moved the store corresponding to
line [\[line:next2\]](#line:next2){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:next2"} to a point after the `release` on
line [\[line:release\]](#line:release){reference-type="ref"
reference="line:release"}:

``` {.numberLines numbers="left" startFrom="1"}
l = malloc(sizeof *l);
      l->data = data;
      acquire(&listlock);
      l->next = list;   (*@\label{line:next2}@*)
      list = l;      
      release(&listlock);  (*@\label{line:release}@*)
```

If such a re-ordering occurred, there would be a window during which
another CPU could acquire the lock and observe the updated `list`, but
see an uninitialized `list->next`.

The good news is that compilers and CPUs help concurrent programmers by
following a set of rules called the *memory model*, and by providing
some primitives to help programmers control re-ordering.

To tell the hardware and compiler not to re-order, xv6 uses
`__sync_synchronize()` in both `acquire`
[([1271]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L22)
and `release`
[([1302]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L47).
`__sync_synchronize()` is a *memory barrier*: it tells the compiler and
CPU to not reorder loads or stores across the barrier. The barriers in
xv6's `acquire` and `release` force order in almost all cases where it
matters, since xv6 uses locks around accesses to shared data.
Chapter [11](#CH:LOCK2){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:LOCK2"}
discusses a few exceptions.

Sleep locks
-----------

Sometimes xv6 needs to hold a lock for a long time. For example, the
file system (Chapter [10](#CH:FS){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:FS"}) keeps a file locked while reading and writing its
content on the disk, and these disk operations can take tens of
milliseconds. Holding a spinlock that long would lead to waste if
another process wanted to acquire it, since the acquiring process would
waste CPU for a long time while spinning. Another drawback of spinlocks
is that a process cannot yield the CPU while retaining a spinlock; we'd
like to do this so that other processes can use the CPU while the
process with the lock waits for the disk. Yielding while holding a
spinlock is illegal because it might lead to deadlock if a second thread
then tried to acquire the spinlock; since `acquire` doesn't yield the
CPU, the second thread's spinning might prevent the first thread from
running and releasing the lock. Yielding while holding a lock would also
violate the requirement that interrupts must be off while a spinlock is
held. Thus we'd like a type of lock that yields the CPU while waiting to
acquire, and allows yields (and interrupts) while the lock is held.

Xv6 provides such locks in the form of *sleep-locks*. `acquiresleep`
[([4471]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sleeplock.c#L22)
yields the CPU while waiting, using techniques that will be explained in
Chapter [9](#CH:SLEEP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:SLEEP"}. At a
high level, a sleep-lock has a `locked` field that is protected by a
spinlock, and `acquiresleep` 's call to `sleep` atomically yields the
CPU and releases the spinlock. The result is that other threads can
execute while `acquiresleep` waits.

Because sleep-locks leave interrupts enabled, they cannot be used in
interrupt handlers. Because `acquiresleep` may yield the CPU,
sleep-locks cannot be used inside spinlock critical sections (though
spinlocks can be used inside sleep-lock critical sections).

Spin-locks are best suited to short critical sections, since waiting for
them wastes CPU time; sleep-locks work well for lengthy operations.

Real world
----------

Programming with locks remains challenging despite years of research
into concurrency primitives and parallelism. It is often best to conceal
locks within higher-level constructs like synchronized queues, although
xv6 does not do this. If you program with locks, it is wise to use a
tool that attempts to identify races, because it is easy to miss an
invariant that requires a lock.

Most operating systems support POSIX threads (Pthreads), which allow a
user process to have several threads running concurrently on different
CPUs. Pthreads has support for user-level locks, barriers, etc. Pthreads
also allows a programmer to optionally specify that a lock should be
re-entrant.

Supporting Pthreads at user level requires support from the operating
system. For example, it should be the case that if one pthread blocks in
a system call, another pthread of the same process should be able to run
on that CPU. As another example, if a pthread changes its process's
address space (e.g., maps or unmaps memory), the kernel must arrange
that other CPUs that run threads of the same process update their
hardware page tables to reflect the change in the address space.

It is possible to implement locks without atomic
instructions [@lamport:bakery], but it is expensive, so most operating
systems use atomic instructions.

Locks can be expensive if many CPUs try to acquire the same lock at the
same time. If one CPU has a lock cached in its local cache, and another
CPU must acquire the lock, then the atomic instruction to update the
cache line that holds the lock must move the line from the one CPU's
cache to the other CPU's cache, and perhaps invalidate any other copies
of the cache line. Fetching a cache line from another CPU's cache can be
orders of magnitude more expensive than fetching a line from a local
cache.

To avoid the expenses associated with locks, many operating systems use
lock-free data structures and
algorithms [@herlihy:art; @mckenney:rcuusage]. For example, it is
possible to implement a linked list like the one in the beginning of the
chapter that requires no locks during list searches, and one atomic
instruction to insert an item in a list. Lock-free programming is more
complicated, however, than programming locks; for example, one must
worry about instruction and memory reordering. Programming with locks is
already hard, so xv6 avoids the additional complexity of lock-free
programming.

Exercises
---------

1.  Comment out the calls to `acquire` and `release` in `kalloc`
    [([3027]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L69).
    This seems like it should cause problems for kernel code that calls
    `kalloc`; what symptoms do you expect to see? When you run xv6, do
    you see these symptoms? How about when running `usertests`? If you
    don't see a problem, why not? See if you can provoke a problem by
    inserting dummy loops into the critical section of `kalloc`.

2.  Suppose that you instead commented out the locking in `kfree` (after
    restoring locking in `kalloc`). What might now go wrong? Is lack of
    locks in `kfree` less harmful than in `kalloc`?

3.  If two CPUs call `kalloc` at the same time, one will have to wait
    for the other, which is bad for performance. Modify `kalloc.c` to
    have more parallelism, so that simultaneous calls to `kalloc` from
    different CPUs can proceed without waiting for each other.

4.  Write a parallel program using POSIX threads, which is supported on
    most operating systems. For example, implement a parallel hash table
    and measure if the number of puts/gets scales with increasing number
    of CPUs.

5.  Implement a subset of Pthreads in xv6. That is, implement a
    user-level thread library so that a user process can have more than
    1 thread and arrange that these threads can run in parallel on
    different CPUs. Come up with a design that correctly handles a
    thread making a blocking system call and changing its shared address
    space.

Scheduling {#CH:SCHED}
==========

Any operating system is likely to run with more processes than the
computer has CPUs, so a plan is needed to time-share the CPUs among the
processes. Ideally the sharing would be transparent to user processes. A
common approach is to provide each process with the illusion that it has
its own virtual CPU by *multiplexing* the processes onto the hardware
CPUs. This chapter explains how xv6 achieves this multiplexing.

Before proceeding with this chapter, please read `kernel/proc.h`,
`kernel/swtch.S`, and `yield()`, `sched()`, and `schedule()` in
`kernel/proc.c`.

Multiplexing
------------

Xv6 multiplexes by switching each CPU from one process to another in two
situations. First, xv6 switches when a process makes a system call that
blocks (has to wait), for example `read` or `wait`. Second, xv6
periodically forces a switch to cope with processes that compute for
long periods without blocking. The former are called voluntary switches,
the latter involuntary.

Implementing multiplexing poses a few challenges. First, how to switch
from one process to another? The basic idea is to save and restore CPU
registers, though the fact that this cannot be expressed in C makes it
tricky. Second, how to force switches in a way that is transparent to
user processes? Xv6 uses the standard technique in which a hardware
timer's interrupts drive context switches. Third, all of the CPUs switch
among the same set of processes, so a locking plan is necessary to avoid
mistakes such as two CPUs deciding to run the same process at the same
time. Fourth, a process's memory and other resources must be freed when
the process exits, but it cannot finish all of this itself. Fifth, each
CPU of a multi-core machine must remember which process it is executing
so that system calls affect the correct process's kernel state.

Context switch overview
-----------------------

The term "context switch" refers to the steps involved in a CPU leaving
off execution of one kernel thread (usually for later resumption), and
resuming execution of a different kernel thread; this switching is the
heart of multiplexing. Xv6 does not directly context switch from one
process's kernel thread to another process's kernel thread; instead, a
kernel thread gives up the CPU by context-switching to that CPU's
"scheduler thread," and the scheduler thread picks a different process's
kernel thread to run, and context-switches to that thread.

![Switching from one user process to another. In this example, xv6 runs
with one CPU (and thus one scheduler
thread).](fig/switch.pdf){#fig:switch}

At a broader scope, the steps involved in switching from one user
process to another are illustrated in
Figure [8.1](#fig:switch){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:switch"}:
a trap (system call or interrupt) from the old process's user space to
its kernel thread, a context switch to the current CPU's scheduler
thread, a context switch to a new process's kernel thread, and a trap
return to the user-level process.

Code: Context switching
-----------------------

The function `swtch()` in `kernel/swtch.S` contains the heart of thread
context switching: it saves the switched-from thread's CPU registers,
and restores the previously-saved registers of the switched-to thread.
The basic reason this is sufficient is that a thread's state consist of
data in memory (e.g. its stack) plus its CPU registers; thread memory
need not saved and restored because different threads keep their data in
different areas of RAM; but the CPU has only one set of registers so
they must be switched (saved and restored) between threads.

Each thread's `struct proc` includes a `struct context` that holds the
thread's saved registers when it is not running. A CPU's scheduler
thread's `struct context` is in that CPU's `struct cpu`. When thread X
wishes to switch to thread Y, thread X calls
`swtch(&X’s context, &Y’s context)`. `swtch()` saves the current CPU
registers in X's context, then loads the content of Y's context into the
CPU registers, then returns.

Here's an abbreviated copy of `swtch`:

    swtch:
            sd ra, 0(a0)
            sd sp, 8(a0)
            sd s0, 16(a0)
            ...
            sd s11, 104(a0)

            ld ra, 0(a1)
            ld sp, 8(a1)
            ld s0, 16(a1)
            ...
            ld s11, 104(a1)
            
            ret

`a0` holds the first function argument, and `a1` the second; in this
case, the two `struct context` pointers. `16(a0)` refers to an offset 16
bytes into the memory pointed to by `a0`; referring to the definition of
`struct context` in `kernel/proc.h`
[([1951]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.h#L2), this
is the structure field called `s0`.

Where does `swtch`'s `ret` return to? It returns to the instruction that
the `ra` register points to. In the example in which thread X calls
`swtch()` to switch to Y, when `ret` executes, `ra` has just been loaded
from Y's `struct context`. And the `ra` in Y's `struct context` was
originally saved by Y's call to `swtch` when Y gave up the CPU in the
past. So the `ret` returns to the instruction after the point at which Y
called `swtch()`; that is, X's call to `swtch()` returns as if returning
from Y's original call to `swtch()`. And `sp` will be Y's stack pointer,
since `swtch` loaded `sp` from Y's ` struct context`; thus on return, Y
will execute on its own stack. `swtch()` need not directly save or
restore the program counter; it's enough to save and restore `ra`.

`swtch`
[([2902]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/swtch.S#L3) saves
callee-saved registers (`ra,sp,s0..s11`) but not caller-saved registers.
The RISC-V calling convention requires that if code needs to preserve
the value in a caller-saved register across a function call, the
compiler must generate instructions that save the register to the stack
before the function call, and restore from the stack when the function
returns. So `swtch` can rely on the function that called it having
already saved the caller-saved registers (either that, or the calling
function didn't need the values in the registers).

Code: Scheduling
----------------

The last section looked at the internals of `swtch`; now let's take
`swtch` as a given and examine switching from one process's kernel
thread through the scheduler to another process. The scheduler exists in
the form of a special thread per CPU, each running the `scheduler`
function. This function is in charge of choosing which process to run
next. Each CPU has its own scheduler thread because more than one CPU
may be looking for something to run at any given time. Process switching
always goes through the scheduler thread, rather than direct from one
process to another, to avoid some situations in which there would be no
stack on which to execute the scheduler (e.g. if the old process has
exited, or there is no other process that currently wants to run).

A process that wants to give up the CPU must acquire its own process
lock `p->lock`, release any other locks it is holding, update its own
state (`p->state`), and then call `sched`. You can see this sequence in
`yield`
[([2629]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L494),
`sleep` and `kexit`. `sched` calls `swtch` to save the current context
in `p->context` and switch to the scheduler context in `cpu->context`.
`swtch` returns on the scheduler's stack as though `scheduler`'s `swtch`
had returned
[([2582]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L449).

`scheduler`
[([2558]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L425) runs
a loop: find a process to run, `swtch()` to it, eventually it will
`swtch()` back to the scheduler, which continues its loop. The scheduler
loops over the process table looking for a runnable process, one that
has `p->state` `==` `RUNNABLE`. Once it finds a process, it sets the
per-CPU current process variable `c->proc`, marks the process as
`RUNNING`, and then calls `swtch` to start running it
[[(2577-2582)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L444-L449).
At some point in the past, the target process must have called
`swtch()`; the scheduler's call to `swtch()` effectively returns from
that earlier call.
Figure [\[fig:inout\]](#fig:inout){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:inout"} illustrates this pattern.

xv6 holds `p->lock` across calls to `swtch`: the caller of `swtch`
acquires the lock, but it's released in the target after `swtch`
returns. This arrangement is unusual: it's more common for the thread
that acquires a lock to also release it. Xv6's context switching breaks
this convention because `p->state` and `p->context` must be updated
together atomically. For example, if `p->lock` were released before
invoking `swtch`, a different CPU $c$ might decide to run the process
because its state is `RUNNABLE`. CPU $c$ will invoke `swtch` which will
restore from `p->context` while the original CPU is still saving into
`p->context`. The result would be that the process would be restored
with partially-saved registers on CPU $c$ and that both CPUs will be
using the same stack, which would cause chaos. Once `yield` has started
to modify a running process's state to make it `RUNNABLE`, `p->lock`
must remain held until the process has saved all its registers and the
scheduler is running on its stack. The earliest correct release point is
after `scheduler` (running on its own stack) clears `c->proc`.
Similarly, once `scheduler` starts to convert a `RUNNABLE` process to
`RUNNING`, the lock cannot be released until the process's kernel thread
is completely running (after the `swtch`, for example in `yield`).

There is one case when the scheduler's call to `swtch` does not end up
in `sched`. `allocproc` sets the context `ra` register of a new process
to `forkret`
[([2653]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L506), so
that its first `swtch` "returns" to the start of that function.
`forkret` exists to release the `p->lock` and set up some control
registers and trapframe fields that are required in order to return to
user space. At the end, `forkret` simulates the normal return path from
a system call back to user space.

Code: mycpu and myproc
----------------------

Xv6 often needs a pointer to the current process's `proc` structure. On
a uniprocessor one could have a global variable pointing to the current
`proc`. This doesn't work on a multi-core machine, since each CPU
executes a different process. The way to solve this problem is to
exploit the fact that each CPU has its own set of registers.

While a given CPU is executing in the kernel, xv6 ensures that the CPU's
`tp` register always holds the CPU's hartid. RISC-V numbers its CPUs,
giving each a unique *hartid*. `mycpu`
[([2178]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L74) uses
`tp` to index an array of `cpu` structures and return the one for the
current CPU. A `struct cpu`
[([1971]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.h#L22) holds
a pointer to the `proc` structure of the process currently running on
that CPU (if any), saved registers for the CPU's scheduler thread, and
the count of nested spinlocks needed to manage interrupt disabling.

Ensuring that a CPU's `tp` holds the CPU's hartid is a little involved,
since user code is free to modify `tp`. `start` sets the `tp` register
early in the CPU's boot sequence, while still in machine mode
[([1094]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/start.c#L45).
While preparing to return to user space, `prepare_return` saves `tp` in
the trampoline page, in case user code modifies it. Finally, `uservec`
restores that saved `tp` when entering the kernel from user space
[([3127]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/trampoline.S#L78).
The compiler guarantees never to modify `tp` in kernel code. It would be
more convenient if xv6 could ask the RISC-V hardware for the current
hartid whenever needed, but RISC-V allows that only in machine mode, not
in supervisor mode.

The return values of `cpuid` and `mycpu` are fragile: if the timer were
to interrupt and cause the thread to yield and later resume execution on
a different CPU, a previously returned value would no longer be correct.
To avoid this problem, xv6 requires code to disable interrupts before
calling `cpuid()` or `mycpu()`, and only enable interrupts when done
using the returned value.

The function `myproc`
[([2187]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L83)
returns the `struct proc` pointer for the process that is running on the
current CPU. `myproc` disables interrupts, invokes `mycpu`, fetches the
current process pointer (`c->proc`) out of the `struct cpu`, and then
enables interrupts. The return value of `myproc` is safe to use even if
interrupts are enabled: if a timer interrupt moves the calling process
to a different CPU, its `struct proc` pointer will stay the same.

Real world
----------

The xv6 scheduler implements a simple scheduling policy that runs each
process in turn. This policy is called *round robin*. Real operating
systems implement more sophisticated policies that, for example, allow
processes to have priorities. The idea is that a runnable high-priority
process will be preferred by the scheduler over a runnable low-priority
process. These policies can become complex because there are often
competing goals: for example, the operating system might also want to
guarantee fairness and high throughput.

Exercises
---------

1.  Modify xv6 to use only one context switch when switching from one
    process's kernel thread to another, rather than switching through
    the scheduler thread. The yielding thread will need to select the
    next thread itself and call `swtch`. The challenges will be to
    prevent multiple CPUs from executing the same thread accidentally;
    to get the locking right; and to avoid deadlocks.

Sleep and Wakeup {#CH:SLEEP}
================

Scheduling and locks help conceal the actions of one thread from
another, but we also need abstractions that help threads intentionally
interact. For example, the reader of a pipe in xv6 may need to wait for
a writing process to produce data; a parent's call to `wait` may need to
wait for a child to exit; and a process reading the disk needs to wait
for the disk hardware to finish the read. The xv6 kernel uses a
mechanism called sleep and wakeup in these situations (and many others).
Sleep allows a kernel thread to wait for some condition to be true;
another thread or an interrupt handler can cause the condition to be
true (typically by modifying some variable(s)) and then call wakeup to
indicate that threads waiting for the condition should resume. Sleep and
wakeup are often called *sequence coordination* or *conditional
synchronization* mechanisms.

Before proceeding, please read the functions `sleep()` and ` wakeup()`
in `kernel/proc.c`, and all of file `kernel/pipe.c`.

Overview
--------

The sleep/wakeup interface looks like:

    void sleep(void *chan, struct spinlock *lk)
    void wakeup(void *chan)

`sleep()` marks the calling process as `SLEEPING` (not `RUNNABLE`) and
releases the CPU by context-switching to the scheduler, so that other
processes can run. The `chan` argument is called the *wait channel*.
`wakeup(chan)` wakes up all processes (if any) that have called
`sleep(chan, ...)` with the same `chan` value. `sleep` and `wakeup`
treat `chan` as an opaque 64-bit value; the only thing they do with it
is compare for equality. The usual pattern is for callers to pass the
address of some convenient object as the `chan` argument.

Kernel code calls `sleep` to wait for some *condition* to become true.
For example, the kernel code that reads from a pipe calls `sleep` if the
pipe buffer is currently empty; the condition in this case is the pipe
buffer becoming non-empty (due to another process writing to the pipe).
`sleep` and `wakeup` do not know what the condition is: only the calling
code knows. The usual pattern is for the caller to first check the
condition, and call `sleep` if it is not true; code that later makes the
condition true calls `wakeup`.

Here's a sketch of how the xv6 kernel pipe code uses `sleep` and
`wakeup`:

    piperead(pipe){
      acquire(&pipe->lock);
      while(there's no data in pipe->buffer){
        (*@\textcolor{blue}{// ZZZ}@*)
        sleep(&pipe, &pipe->lock);
      }
      remove the data from the pipe;
      release(&pipe->lock);
    }

    pipewrite(pipe){
      acquire(&pipe->lock);
      append data to pipe->buffer;
      wakeup(&pipe);
      release(&pipe->lock);
    }

This code uses the address of the pipe data structure as the wait
channel.

What is the `lk` argument to `sleep`? In all uses of `sleep`/`wakeup`
the condition involves shared data, used by both the thread that sleeps
and the thread that calls `wakeup`, so there always turns out to be a
lock that protects the condition. That lock is called the *condition
lock*. In the pipe code above, both functions use the pipe and its
buffer while holding the pipe lock, which in this case is also the
condition lock. It's a rule that any code that calls `sleep` or `wakeup`
must hold the condition lock, and that the lock must be passed to
`sleep` as the second argument.

The reason that the condition lock must be held when `sleep` is called,
and that it must be passed to `sleep`, is to prevent the possibility
that another thread might call `wakeup` between the check of the
condition and the call to `sleep`. A call to `wakeup` at that point
would find no sleeping process to wake up; the `wakeup` would simply
return. But then the call to `sleep` might never wake up, since the
`wakeup` intended for it has already happened. This undesirable
situation is called a *lost wake-up*.

In the pipe example above, the lost wake-up being avoided is the
possibility that a thread on another CPU might call `pipewrite` at the
point marked `ZZZ`, between `piperead`'s check of the condition and its
call to `sleep`. The fact that `piperead` holds the pipe lock during the
time between when it checks the condition and calls `sleep` prevents
`pipewrite` from executing, and thus prevents a lost wake-up.

`sleep()` releases the condition lock so that the code calling
`wakeup()` can proceed. `sleep()` also context-switches to the scheduler
in order to let other threads run while it is waiting. The
implementation performs these two steps in a way that is atomic
(indivisible) with respect to `wakeup()`, to prevent lost wake-ups.

Code: Sleep and wakeup
----------------------

Xv6's `sleep`
[([2703]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L543) and
`wakeup`
[([2734]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L574)
implement the interface used in the example above. The basic idea is to
have `sleep` mark the current process as `SLEEPING` and then call
`sched` to release the CPU; `wakeup` looks for a process sleeping on the
given wait channel and marks it as `RUNNABLE`.

`sleep` acquires `p->lock`
[([2714]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L554) and
*only then* releases the condition lock `lk`. The fact that `sleep`
holds one or the other of these locks at all times is what prevents a
concurrent `wakeup` (which must acquire and hold both) from acting, and
thus prevents a lost wake-up. Now that `sleep` holds just `p->lock`, it
can put the process to sleep by recording the wait channel, changing the
process state to `SLEEPING`, and calling `sched`
[[(2718-2721)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L558-L561).
In a moment it will be clear why it's critical that `p->lock` is not
released (by `scheduler`) until after the process is marked `SLEEPING`.

At some point, a process will acquire the condition lock, set the
condition that the sleeper is waiting for, and call `wakeup(chan)`. It's
important that `wakeup` is called while holding the condition lock[^3].
`wakeup` loops over the process table
[([2734]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L574). It
acquires the `p->lock` of each process it inspects. When `wakeup` finds
a process in state `SLEEPING` with a matching `chan`, it changes that
process's state to `RUNNABLE`. The next time `scheduler` runs, it will
see that the process is ready to be run.

Why do the locking rules for `sleep` and `wakeup` ensure that a process
that's going to sleep won't miss a concurrent wakeup? The going-to-sleep
process holds either the condition lock or its own `p->lock` or both
from *before* it checks the condition until *after* it has marked itself
as `SLEEPING`; see
Figure [\[fig:overlap\]](#fig:overlap){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:overlap"}. The process calling `wakeup` needs to aquire
*both* locks. The waker might acquire the locks first, which means it
will make the condition true before the consuming thread checks the
condition, and the consuming thread won't need to call `sleep()`; or the
waker's `acquire()`s might have to wait until the consuming thread has
completely finished going to sleep and releases the locks, in which case
the waker will then see that the consuming thread is marked `SLEEPING`
and will wake it up.

Sometimes multiple processes are sleeping on the same channel; for
example, more than one process reading from a pipe. A single call to
`wakeup` will wake them all up. One of them will run first and acquire
the lock that `sleep` was called with, and (in the case of pipes) read
whatever data is waiting. The other processes will find that, despite
being woken up, there is no data to be read. From their point of view
the wakeup was "spurious," and they must sleep again. For this reason
`sleep` is always called inside a loop that re-checks the condition, as
in `P` above.

No harm is done if two uses of sleep/wakeup accidentally choose the same
channel: they will see spurious wakeups, but looping as described above
will tolerate this problem. Much of the charm of sleep/wakeup is that it
is both lightweight (no need to create special data structures to act as
wait channels) and provides a layer of indirection (callers need not
know which specific process they are interacting with).

Code: Pipes
-----------

xv6's pipes are an example of code that uses `sleep` and `wakeup` to
synchronize producers and consumers. We saw the interface for pipes in
Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:UNIX"}: bytes
written to one end of a pipe are copied to an in-kernel buffer and then
can be read from the other end of the pipe. Future chapters will examine
the file descriptor support surrounding pipes, but let's look now at the
implementations of `pipewrite` and `piperead`.

Each pipe is represented by a `struct pipe`, which contains a `lock` and
a `data` buffer. The fields `nread` and `nwrite` count the total number
of bytes read from and written to the buffer. The buffer wraps around:
the next byte written after `buf[PIPESIZE-1]` is `buf[0]`. The counts do
not wrap. This convention lets the implementation distinguish a full
buffer (`nwrite` `==` `nread+PIPESIZE`) from an empty buffer (`nwrite`
`==` `nread`), but it means that indexing into the buffer must use
`buf[nread` `%` `PIPESIZE]` instead of just `buf[nread]` (and similarly
for `nwrite`).

Let's suppose that calls to `piperead` and `pipewrite` happen
simultaneously on two different CPUs. `pipewrite`
[([6679]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L77)
begins by acquiring the pipe's lock, which protects the counts, the
data, and their associated invariants. `piperead`
[([6708]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L106) then
tries to acquire the lock too, but cannot. It spins in `acquire`
[([1271]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/spinlock.c#L22)
waiting for the lock. While `piperead` waits, `pipewrite` loops over the
bytes being written (`addr[0..n-1]`), adding each to the pipe in turn
[([6697]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L95).
During this loop, it could happen that the buffer fills
[([6690]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L88). In
this case, `pipewrite` calls `wakeup` to alert any sleeping readers to
the fact that there is data waiting in the buffer and then sleeps on
`&pi->nwrite` to wait for a reader to take some bytes out of the buffer.
`sleep` releases the pipe's lock as part of putting `pipewrite`'s
process to sleep.

`piperead` now acquires the pipe's lock and enters its critical section:
it finds that `pi->nread` `!=` `pi->nwrite`
[([6715]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L113)
(`pipewrite` went to sleep because `pi->nwrite` `==` `pi->nread` `+`
`PIPESIZE`
[([6690]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L88)), so
it falls through to the `for` loop, copies data out of the pipe
[([6722]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L120), and
increments `nread` by the number of bytes copied. That much space in the
buffer is now available for writing, so `piperead` calls `wakeup`
[([6733]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L131) to
wake any sleeping writers before it returns. `wakeup` finds a process
sleeping on `&pi->nwrite`, the process that was running `pipewrite` but
stopped when the buffer filled. It marks that process as `RUNNABLE`.

The pipe code uses separate wait channels for reader and writer
(`pi->nread` and `pi->nwrite`); this might make the system more
efficient in the unlikely event that there are lots of readers and
writers waiting for the same pipe. The pipe code sleeps inside a loop
checking the sleep condition; if there are multiple readers or writers,
all but the first process to wake up will see the condition is false and
sleep again.

Code: Wait, exit, and kill
--------------------------

Please read the code for functions `kwait()`, `kexit()`, and `kkill()`
in `kernel/proc.c`; these are the internal implementations of the
corresponding system calls.

`sleep` and `wakeup` can be used for many kinds of waiting. An
interesting example, introduced in
Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:UNIX"}, is the
interaction between a child's `exit` and its parent's `wait`. At the
time of the child's death, the parent may already be sleeping in `wait`,
or may be doing something else; in the latter case, a subsequent call to
`wait` must observe the child's death, perhaps long after it calls
`exit`. The way that xv6 records the child's demise until `wait`
observes it is for `exit` to put the caller into the `ZOMBIE` state,
where it stays until the parent's `wait` notices it, changes the child's
state to `UNUSED`, copies the child's exit status, and returns the
child's process ID to the parent. If the parent exits before the child,
the parent gives the child to the `init` process, which perpetually
calls `wait`; thus every child has a parent to clean up after it. A
challenge is to avoid races and deadlock between simultaneous parent
`wait` and child `exit`, as well as simultaneous `exit` and `exit`.

`kwait`, the kernel implementation for `wait`, starts by acquiring
`wait_lock`
[([2503]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L371),
which acts as the condition lock that helps ensure that `kwait` doesn't
miss a `wakeup` from an exiting child. Then `kwait` scans the process
table. If it finds a child in `ZOMBIE` state, it frees that child's
resources and its `proc` structure, copies the child's exit status to
the address supplied to `wait` (if it is not 0), and returns the child's
process ID. If `kwait` finds children but none have exited, it calls
`sleep` to wait for any of them to exit
[([2545]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L413),
then scans again. `kwait` often holds two locks, `wait_lock` and some
process's `pp->lock`; the deadlock-avoiding order is first `wait_lock`
and then `pp->lock`.

`kexit`
[([2454]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L327)
records the exit status, frees some resources, calls `reparent` to give
any children to the `init` process, wakes up the parent in case it is in
`wait`, marks the caller as a zombie, and permanently yields the CPU.
`kexit` holds both `wait_lock` and `p->lock` during this sequence. It
holds `wait_lock` because it's the condition lock for the
`wakeup(p->parent)`, preventing a parent in `wait` from losing the
wakeup. `kexit` must hold `p->lock` for this sequence also, to prevent a
parent in `wait` from seeing that the child is in state `ZOMBIE` before
the child has finally called `swtch`. `kexit` acquires these locks in
the same order as `kwait` to avoid deadlock.

It may look incorrect for `kexit` to wake up the parent before setting
its state to `ZOMBIE`, but that is safe: although `wakeup` may cause the
parent to run, the loop in the parent's `kwait` cannot examine the child
until the child's `p->lock` is released by `scheduler`, so `kwait` can't
look at the exiting process until after `kexit` has set its state to
`ZOMBIE`
[([2486]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L359).

While `exit` allows a process to terminate itself, the `kill` system
call [([2754]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L593)
lets one process request that another terminate. It would be too complex
for `kill` to directly destroy the victim process, since the victim
might be executing on another CPU, perhaps in the middle of a sensitive
sequence of updates to kernel data structures. Thus `kkill` does very
little: it just sets the victim's `p->killed` and, if it is sleeping,
wakes it up. Eventually the victim will enter or leave the kernel, at
which point code in `usertrap` will call `kexit` if `p->killed` is set
(it checks by calling `killed`
[([2783]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L622)). If
the victim is running in user space, it will see that it has been killed
the next time it enters the kernel by making a system call or because
the timer (or some other device) interrupts.

If the victim process is in `sleep`, `kkill`'s call to `wakeup` will
cause the victim to return from `sleep`. This is potentially dangerous
because the condition being waited for may not be true. However, xv6
calls to `sleep` are always wrapped in a `while` loop that re-tests the
condition after `sleep` returns. Some calls to `sleep` also test
`p->killed` in the loop, and abandon the current activity if it is set.
This is only done when such abandonment would be correct. For example,
the pipe read and write code
[([6686]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L84)
returns if the killed flag is set; eventually the code will return back
to trap, which will again check `p->killed` and exit.

Some xv6 `sleep` loops do not check `p->killed` because the code is in
the middle of a multi-step system call that should be atomic (i.e.,
would be incorrect if abandoned midway through). The virtio driver
[([7688]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/virtio_disk.c#L285)
is an example: it does not check `p->killed` because a disk operation
may be one of a set of writes that are all needed in order for the file
system to be left in a correct state. A process that is killed while
waiting for disk I/O won't exit until it completes the current system
call and `usertrap` sees the killed flag.

Process Locking
---------------

The lock associated with each process (`p->lock`) is the most complex
lock in xv6. A simple way to think about `p->lock` is that it must be
held while reading or writing any of the following `struct proc` fields:
`p->state`, `p->chan`, `p->killed`, `p->xstate`, and `p->pid`. These
fields can be used by other processes, or by scheduler threads on other
CPUs, so it's natural that they must be protected by a lock.

However, most uses of `p->lock` are protecting higher-level invariants
of xv6's process data structures and algorithms. Here's the full set of
things that `p->lock` does:

-   Along with `p->state`, it prevents races in allocating `proc[]`
    slots for new processes.

-   It conceals a process from view while it is being created or
    destroyed.

-   It prevents a parent's `wait` from collecting a process that has set
    its state to `ZOMBIE` but has not yet yielded the CPU.

-   It prevents another CPU's scheduler from deciding to run a yielding
    process after it sets its state to `RUNNABLE` but before it finishes
    `swtch`.

-   It ensures that only one CPU's scheduler decides to run a `RUNNABLE`
    processes.

-   It prevents a timer interrupt from causing a process to yield while
    it is in `swtch`.

-   Along with the condition lock, it helps prevent `wakeup` from
    overlooking a process that is calling `sleep` but has not finished
    yielding the CPU.

-   It prevents the victim process of `kill` from exiting and perhaps
    being re-allocated between `kkill`'s check of `p->pid` and setting
    `p->killed`.

-   It makes `kkill`'s check and write of `p->state` atomic.

The `p->parent` field is protected by the global lock `wait_lock` rather
than by `p->lock`. Only a process's parent modifies `p->parent`, though
the field is read both by the process itself and by other processes
searching for their children. The purpose of `wait_lock` is to act as
the condition lock when `wait` sleeps waiting for any child to exit. An
exiting child holds either `wait_lock` or `p->lock` until after it has
set its state to `ZOMBIE`, woken up its parent, and yielded the CPU.
`wait_lock` also serializes concurrent `exit`s by a parent and child, so
that the `init` process (which inherits the child) is guaranteed to be
woken up from its `wait`. `wait_lock` is a global lock rather than a
per-process lock in each parent, because, until a process acquires it,
it cannot know who its parent is.

Real world
----------

`sleep` and `wakeup` are a simple and effective synchronization method,
but there are many others; semaphores [@dijkstra65] are an example. The
first challenge in all of them is to avoid the "lost wakeups" problem we
saw at the beginning of the chapter. The original Unix kernel's `sleep`
simply disabled interrupts, which sufficed because Unix ran on a
single-CPU system. Because xv6 runs on multiprocessors, it adds an
explicit lock to `sleep`. FreeBSD's `msleep` takes the same approach.
Plan 9's `sleep` uses a callback function that runs with the scheduling
lock held just before going to sleep; the function serves as a
last-minute check of the sleep condition, to avoid lost wakeups. The
Linux kernel's `sleep` uses an explicit process queue, called a wait
queue, instead of a wait channel; the queue has its own internal lock.

Scanning the entire set of processes in `wakeup` is inefficient. A
better solution is to replace the `chan` in both `sleep` and `wakeup`
with a data structure that holds a list of processes sleeping on that
structure, such as Linux's wait queue. Plan 9's `sleep` and `wakeup`
call that structure a rendezvous point. Many thread libraries refer to
the same structure as a condition variable; in that context, the
operations `sleep` and `wakeup` are called `wait` and `signal`. All of
these mechanisms share the same flavor: the sleep condition is protected
by some kind of lock dropped atomically during sleep.

xv6's `wakeup` wakes up all processes that are waiting on a particular
wait channel. If there are more than one of them, they will all try to
acquire the condition lock and re-check the condition; in many cases
only one will be able to do anything useful (e.g., read all the data
waiting in a pipe). The rest will find the condition is no longer true
and go back to sleep; it was a waste of CPU time to wake them up. As a
result, most condition variable designs provide two primitives:
`signal`, which wakes up one of the processes waiting for the condition
variable, and `broadcast`, which wakes up all of them.

Forcibly killing processes poses some problems. For example, a killed
process may be deep inside the kernel sleeping, and unwinding its stack
requires care, since each function on the call stack may need to do some
clean-up. Some languages help out by providing an exception mechanism,
but not C. Furthermore, there are other events that can cause a sleeping
process to be woken up, even though the event it is waiting for has not
happened yet. For example, when a Unix process is sleeping, another
process may send a `signal` to it. In this case, the process will return
from the interrupted system call with the value -1 and with the error
code set to EINTR. The application can check for these values and decide
what to do. Xv6 doesn't support signals and this complexity doesn't
arise.

Xv6's support for `kill` is not entirely satisfactory: there are sleep
loops which probably should check for `p->killed`. A related problem is
that, even for `sleep` loops that check `p->killed`, there is a race
between `sleep` and `kill`; the latter may set `p->killed` and try to
wake up the victim just after the victim's loop checks `p->killed` but
before it calls `sleep`. If this problem occurs, the victim won't notice
the `p->killed` until the condition it is waiting for occurs. This may
be quite a bit later or even never (e.g., if the victim is waiting for
input from the console, but the user doesn't type any input).

Exercises
---------

1.  Implement counting semaphores in xv6. Choose a few of xv6's uses of
    sleep and wakeup and replace them with semaphores. Judge the result.

2.  Can you implement a variant of `sleep()` that takes just one
    argument, the channel, and doesn't need a lock argument?

3.  Fix the race mentioned above between `kill` and `sleep`, so that a
    `kill` that occurs after the victim's sleep loop checks `p->killed`
    but before it calls `sleep` results in the victim abandoning the
    current system call.

4.  Design a plan so that every sleep loop checks `p->killed` so that,
    for example, a process that is in the virtio driver can return
    quickly from the while loop if it is killed by another process.

File system {#CH:FS}
===========

The purpose of a file system is to organize and store data. File systems
typically support sharing of data among users and applications, as well
as *persistence* so that data is still available after a reboot.

The xv6 file system provides Unix-like files, directories, and pathnames
(see Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:UNIX"}),
and stores its data on a virtio disk for persistence. The file system
addresses several challenges:

-   The file system needs on-disk data structures to represent the tree
    of named directories and files, to record the identities of the
    blocks that hold each file's content, and to record which areas of
    the disk are free.

-   The file system must support *crash recovery*. That is, if a crash
    (e.g., power failure) occurs, the file system must still work
    correctly after a restart. The risk is that a crash might interrupt
    a sequence of updates and leave inconsistent on-disk data structures
    (e.g., a block that is both used in a file and marked free).

-   Different processes may operate on the file system at the same time,
    so the file-system code must coordinate to maintain invariants.

-   Accessing a disk is orders of magnitude slower than accessing
    memory, so the file system must maintain an in-memory cache of
    popular blocks.

The rest of this chapter explains how xv6 addresses these challenges.

Overview
--------

The xv6 file system implementation is organized in seven layers, shown
in Figure [10.1](#fig:fslayer){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fslayer"}. The disk layer reads and writes blocks on an
virtio hard drive. The buffer cache layer caches disk blocks and
synchronizes access to them, making sure that only one kernel process at
a time can modify the data stored in any particular block. The logging
layer allows higher layers to wrap updates to several blocks in a
*transaction*, and ensures that the blocks are updated atomically in the
face of crashes (i.e., all of them are updated or none). The inode layer
provides individual files, each represented as an *inode* with a unique
i-number and some blocks holding the file's data. The directory layer
implements each directory as a special kind of inode whose content is a
sequence of directory entries, each of which contains a file's name and
i-number. The pathname layer provides hierarchical path names like
`/usr/rtm/xv6/fs.c`, and resolves them with recursive lookup. The file
descriptor layer abstracts many Unix resources (e.g., pipes, devices,
files, etc.) using the file system interface, simplifying the lives of
application programmers.

![Layers of the xv6 file system.](fig/fslayer.pdf){#fig:fslayer}

Disk hardware traditionally presents the data on the disk as a numbered
sequence of 512-byte *blocks* (also called *sectors*): sector 0 is the
first 512 bytes, sector 1 is the next, and so on. The block size that an
operating system uses for its file system maybe different than the
sector size that a disk uses, but typically the block size is a multiple
of the sector size. Xv6 holds copies of blocks that it has read into
memory in objects of type `struct buf`
[([3900]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/buf.h#L1). The
data stored in this structure is sometimes out of sync with the disk: it
might have not yet been read in from disk (the disk is working on it but
hasn't returned the sector's content yet), or it might have been updated
by software but not yet written to the disk.

The file system must have a plan for where it stores inodes and content
blocks on the disk. To do so, xv6 divides the disk into several
sections, as Figure [10.2](#fig:fslayout){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:fslayout"} shows. The file system does not use block 0
(it holds the boot sector). Block 1 is called the *superblock*; it
contains metadata about the file system (the file system size in blocks,
the number of data blocks, the number of inodes, and the number of
blocks in the log). Blocks starting at 2 hold the log. After the log are
the inodes, with multiple inodes per block. After those come bitmap
blocks tracking which data blocks are in use. The remaining blocks are
data blocks; each is either marked free in the bitmap block, or holds
content for a file or directory. The superblock is filled in by a
separate program, called `mkfs`, which builds an initial file system.

The rest of this chapter discusses each layer, starting with the buffer
cache. Look out for situations where well-chosen abstractions at lower
layers ease the design of higher ones.

Buffer cache layer {#s:bcache}
------------------

The buffer cache has two jobs: (1) synchronize access to disk blocks to
ensure that only one copy of a block is in memory and that only one
kernel thread at a time uses that copy; (2) cache popular blocks so that
they don't need to be re-read from the slow disk. The code is in
`bio.c`.

The main interface exported by the buffer cache consists of `bread` and
`bwrite`; the former obtains a *buf* containing a copy of a block which
can be read or modified in memory, and the latter writes a modified
buffer to the appropriate block on the disk. A kernel thread must
release a buffer by calling `brelse` when it is done with it. The buffer
cache uses a per-buffer sleep-lock to ensure that only one thread at a
time uses each buffer (and thus each disk block); `bread` returns a
locked buffer, and `brelse` releases the lock.

Let's return to the buffer cache. The buffer cache has a fixed number of
buffers to hold disk blocks, which means that if the file system asks
for a block that is not already in the cache, the buffer cache must
recycle a buffer currently holding some other block. The buffer cache
recycles the least recently used buffer for the new block. The
assumption is that the least recently used buffer is the one least
likely to be used again soon.

![Structure of the xv6 file system. ](fig/fslayout.pdf){#fig:fslayout}

Code: Buffer cache
------------------

The buffer cache is a doubly-linked list of buffers. The function
`binit`, called by `main`
[([1176]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/main.c#L27),
initializes the list with the `NBUF` buffers in the static array `buf`
[[(4292-4301)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L43-L52).
All other access to the buffer cache refer to the linked list via
`bcache.head`, not the `buf` array.

A buffer has two state fields associated with it. The field `valid`
indicates that the buffer contains a copy of the block. The field `disk`
indicates that the buffer content has been handed to the disk, which may
change the buffer (e.g., write data from the disk into `data`).

`bread`
[([4352]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L93) calls
`bget` to get a buffer for the given sector
[([4356]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L97). If
the buffer needs to be read from disk, `bread` calls `virtio_disk_rw` to
do that before returning the buffer.

`bget` [([4308]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L59)
scans the buffer list for a buffer with the given device and sector
numbers
[[(4314-4322)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L65-L73).
If there is such a buffer, `bget` acquires the sleep-lock for the
buffer. `bget` then returns the locked buffer.

If there is no cached buffer for the given sector, `bget` must make one,
possibly reusing a buffer that held a different sector. It scans the
buffer list a second time, looking for a buffer that is not in use
(`b->refcnt = 0`); any such buffer can be used. `bget` edits the buffer
metadata to record the new device and sector number and acquires its
sleep-lock. Note that the assignment `b->valid = 0` ensures that `bread`
will read the block data from disk rather than incorrectly using the
buffer's previous contents.

It is important that there is at most one cached buffer per disk sector,
to ensure that readers see writes, and because the file system uses
locks on buffers for synchronization. `bget` ensures this invariant by
holding the `bcache.lock` continuously from the first loop's check of
whether the block is cached through the second loop's declaration that
the block is now cached (by setting `dev`, `blockno`, and `refcnt`).
This causes the check for a block's presence and (if not present) the
designation of a buffer to hold the block to be atomic.

It is safe for `bget` to acquire the buffer's sleep-lock outside of the
`bcache.lock` critical section, since the non-zero `b->refcnt` prevents
the buffer from being re-used for a different disk block. The sleep-lock
protects reads and writes of the block's buffered content, while the
`bcache.lock` protects information about which blocks are cached.

If all the buffers are busy, then too many processes are simultaneously
executing file system calls; `bget` panics. A more graceful response
might be to sleep until a buffer became free, though there would then be
a possibility of deadlock.

Once `bread` has read the disk (if needed) and returned the buffer to
its caller, the caller has exclusive use of the buffer and can read or
write the data bytes. If the caller does modify the buffer, it must call
`bwrite` to write the changed data to disk before releasing the buffer.
`bwrite`
[([4366]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L107) calls
`virtio_disk_rw` to talk to the disk hardware.

When the caller is done with a buffer, it must call `brelse` to release
it. (The name `brelse`, a shortening of b-release, is cryptic but worth
learning: it originated in Unix and is used in BSD, Linux, and Solaris
too.) `brelse`
[([4376]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L117)
releases the sleep-lock and moves the buffer to the front of the linked
list
[[(4387-4392)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L128-L133).
Moving the buffer causes the list to be ordered by how recently the
buffers were used (meaning released): the first buffer in the list is
the most recently used, and the last is the least recently used. The two
loops in `bget` take advantage of this: the scan for an existing buffer
must process the entire list in the worst case, but checking the most
recently used buffers first (starting at `bcache.head` and following
`next` pointers) will reduce scan time when there is good locality of
reference. The scan to pick a buffer to reuse picks the least recently
used buffer by scanning backward (following `prev` pointers).

Logging layer
-------------

One of the most interesting problems in file system design is crash
recovery. The problem arises because many file-system operations involve
multiple writes to the disk, and a crash after a subset of the writes
may leave the on-disk file system in an inconsistent state. For example,
suppose a crash occurs during file truncation (setting the length of a
file to zero and freeing its content blocks). Depending on the order of
the disk writes, the crash may either leave an inode with a reference to
a content block that is marked free, or it may leave an allocated but
unreferenced content block.

The latter is relatively benign, but an inode that refers to a freed
block is likely to cause serious problems after a reboot. After reboot,
the kernel might allocate that block to another file, and now we have
two different files pointing unintentionally to the same block. If xv6
supported multiple users, this situation could be a security problem,
since the old file's owner would be able to read and write blocks in the
new file, owned by a different user.

Xv6 solves the problem of crashes during file-system operations with a
simple form of logging. An xv6 system call does not directly write the
on-disk file system data structures. Instead, it places a description of
all the disk writes it wishes to make in a *log* on the disk. Once the
system call has logged all of its writes, it writes a special *commit*
record to the disk indicating that the log contains a complete
operation. At that point the system call copies the writes to the
on-disk file system data structures. After those writes have completed,
the system call erases the log on disk.

If the system should crash and reboot, the file-system code recovers
from the crash as follows, before running any processes. If the log is
marked as containing a complete operation, then the recovery code copies
the writes to where they belong in the on-disk file system. If the log
is not marked as containing a complete operation, the recovery code
ignores the log. The recovery code finishes by erasing the log.

Why does xv6's log solve the problem of crashes during file system
operations? If the crash occurs before the operation commits, then the
log on disk will not be marked as complete, the recovery code will
ignore it, and the state of the disk will be as if the operation had not
even started. If the crash occurs after the operation commits, then
recovery will replay all of the operation's writes, perhaps repeating
them if the operation had started to write them to the on-disk data
structure. In either case, the log makes operations atomic with respect
to crashes: after recovery, either all of the operation's writes appear
on the disk, or none of them appear.

Log design
----------

The log resides at a known fixed location, specified in the superblock.
It consists of a header block followed by a sequence of updated block
copies ("logged blocks"). The header block contains an array of sector
numbers, one for each of the logged blocks, and the count of log blocks.
The count in the header block on disk is either zero, indicating that
there is no transaction in the log, or non-zero, indicating that the log
contains a complete committed transaction with the indicated number of
logged blocks. Xv6 writes the header block when a transaction commits,
but not before, and sets the count to zero after copying the logged
blocks to the file system. Thus a crash midway through a transaction
will result in a count of zero in the log's header block; a crash after
a commit will result in a non-zero count.

Each system call's code indicates the start and end of the sequence of
writes that must be atomic with respect to crashes. To allow concurrent
execution of file-system operations by different processes, the logging
system can accumulate the writes of multiple system calls into one
transaction. Thus a single commit may involve the writes of multiple
complete system calls. To avoid splitting a system call across
transactions, the logging system only commits when no file-system system
calls are underway.

The idea of committing several transactions together is known as *group
commit*. Group commit reduces the number of disk operations because it
amortizes the fixed cost of a commit over multiple operations. Group
commit also hands the disk system more concurrent writes at the same
time, perhaps allowing the disk to write them all during a single disk
rotation. Xv6's virtio driver doesn't support this kind of *batching*,
but xv6's file system design allows for it.

Xv6 dedicates a fixed amount of space on the disk to hold the log. The
total number of blocks written by the system calls in a transaction must
fit in that space. This has two consequences. No single system call can
be allowed to write more distinct blocks than there is space in the log.
This is not a problem for most system calls, but two of them can
potentially write many blocks: `write` and `unlink`. A large file write
may write many data blocks and many bitmap blocks as well as an inode
block; unlinking a large file might write many bitmap blocks and an
inode. Xv6's write system call breaks up large writes into multiple
smaller writes that fit in the log, and `unlink` doesn't cause problems
because in practice the xv6 file system uses only one bitmap block. The
other consequence of limited log space is that the logging system cannot
allow a system call to start unless it is certain that the system call's
writes will fit in the space remaining in the log.

Code: logging
-------------

A typical use of the log in a system call looks like this:

    begin_op();
      ...
      bp = bread(...);
      bp->data[...] = ...;
      log_write(bp);
      ...
      end_op();

`begin_op`
[([4702]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L128) waits
until the logging system is not currently committing, and until there is
enough unreserved log space to hold the writes from this call.
`log.outstanding` counts the number of system calls that have reserved
log space; the total reserved space is `log.outstanding` times
`MAXOPBLOCKS`. Incrementing `log.outstanding` both reserves space and
prevents a commit from occurring during this system call. The code
conservatively assumes that each system call might write up to
`MAXOPBLOCKS` distinct blocks.

`log_write`
[([4790]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L216) acts
as a proxy for `bwrite`. It records the block's sector number in memory,
reserving it a slot in the log on disk, and pins the buffer in the block
cache to prevent the block cache from evicting it. The block must stay
in the cache until committed: until then, the cached copy is the only
record of the modification; it cannot be written to its place on disk
until after commit; and other reads in the same transaction must see the
modifications. `log_write` notices when a block is written multiple
times during a single transaction, and allocates that block the same
slot in the log. This optimization is often called *absorption*. It is
common that, for example, the disk block containing inodes of several
files is written several times within a transaction. By absorbing
several disk writes into one, the file system can save log space and can
achieve better performance because only one copy of the disk block must
be written to disk.

`end_op`
[([4722]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L148) first
decrements the count of outstanding system calls. If the count is now
zero, it commits the current transaction by calling `commit().` There
are four stages in this process. `write_log()`
[([4754]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L180)
copies each block modified in the transaction from the buffer cache to
its slot in the log on disk. `write_head()`
[([4668]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L104)
writes the header block to disk: this is the commit point, and a crash
after the write will result in recovery replaying the transaction's
writes from the log. `install_trans`
[([4619]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L67) reads
each block from the log and writes it to the proper place in the file
system. Finally `end_op` writes the log header with a count of zero;
this has to happen before the next transaction starts writing logged
blocks, so that a crash doesn't result in recovery using one
transaction's header with the subsequent transaction's logged blocks.

`recover_from_log`
[([4682]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L118) is
called from `initlog`
[([4606]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/log.c#L54), which
is called from
`fsinit`[([4891]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L42)
during boot before the first user process runs
[([2666]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L519). It
reads the log header, and mimics the actions of `end_op` if the header
indicates that the log contains a committed transaction.

An example use of the log occurs in `filewrite`
[([5803]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L135). The
transaction looks like this:

    begin_op();
          ilock(f->ip);
          r = writei(f->ip, ...);
          iunlock(f->ip);
          end_op();

This code is wrapped in a loop that breaks up large writes into
individual transactions of just a few sectors at a time, to avoid
overflowing the log. The call to `writei` writes many blocks as part of
this transaction: the file's inode, one or more bitmap blocks, and some
data blocks.

Code: Block allocator
---------------------

File and directory content is stored in disk blocks, which must be
allocated from a free pool. Xv6's block allocator maintains a free
bitmap on disk, with one bit per block. A zero bit indicates that the
corresponding block is free; a one bit indicates that it is in use. The
program `mkfs` sets the bits corresponding to the boot sector,
superblock, log blocks, inode blocks, and bitmap blocks.

The block allocator provides two functions: `balloc` allocates a new
disk block, and `bfree` frees a block. `balloc` The loop in `balloc` at
[([4923]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L73)
considers every block, starting at block 0 up to `sb.size`, the number
of blocks in the file system. It looks for a block whose bitmap bit is
zero, indicating that it is free. If `balloc` finds such a block, it
updates the bitmap and returns the block. For efficiency, the loop is
split into two pieces. The outer loop reads each block of bitmap bits.
The inner loop checks all Bits-Per-Block (`BPB`) bits in a single bitmap
block. The race that might occur if two processes try to allocate a
block at the same time is prevented by the fact that the buffer cache
only lets one process use any one bitmap block at a time.

`bfree` [([4952]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L93)
finds the right bitmap block and clears the right bit. Again the
exclusive use implied by `bread` and `brelse` avoids the need for
explicit locking.

As with much of the code described in the remainder of this chapter,
`balloc` and `bfree` must be called inside a transaction.

Inode layer
-----------

The term *inode* can have one of two related meanings. It might refer to
the on-disk data structure containing a file's size and list of data
block numbers. Or "inode" might refer to an in-memory inode, which
contains a copy of the on-disk inode as well as extra information needed
within the kernel.

The on-disk inodes are packed into a contiguous area of disk called the
inode blocks. Every inode is the same size, so it is easy, given a
number n, to find the nth inode on the disk. In fact, this number n,
called the inode number or i-number, is how inodes are identified in the
implementation.

The on-disk inode is defined by a `struct dinode`
[([4131]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.h#L32). The
`type` field distinguishes between files, directories, and special files
(devices). A type of zero indicates that an on-disk inode is free. The
`nlink` field counts the number of directory entries that refer to this
inode, in order to recognize when the on-disk inode and its data blocks
should be freed. The `size` field records the number of bytes of content
in the file. The `addrs` array records the block numbers of the disk
blocks holding the file's content.

The kernel keeps the set of active inodes in memory in a table called
`itable`; `struct inode`
[([4216]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.h#L17) is
the in-memory copy of a `struct` `dinode` on disk. The kernel stores an
inode in memory only if there are C pointers referring to that inode.
The `ref` field counts the number of C pointers referring to the
in-memory inode, and the kernel discards the inode from memory if the
reference count drops to zero. The `iget` and `iput` functions acquire
and release pointers to an inode, modifying the reference count.
Pointers to an inode can come from file descriptors, current working
directories, and transient kernel code such as `kexec`.

There are four lock or lock-like mechanisms in xv6's inode code.
`itable.lock` protects the invariant that an inode is present in the
inode table at most once, and the invariant that an in-memory inode's
`ref` field counts the number of in-memory pointers to the inode. Each
in-memory inode has a `lock` field containing a sleep-lock, which
ensures exclusive access to the inode's fields (such as file length) as
well as to the inode's file or directory content blocks. An inode's
`ref`, if it is greater than zero, causes the system to maintain the
inode in the table, and not re-use the table entry for a different
inode. Finally, each inode contains a `nlink` field (on disk and copied
in memory if in memory) that counts the number of directory entries that
refer to a file; xv6 won't free an inode if its link count is greater
than zero.

A `struct` `inode` pointer returned by `iget()` is guaranteed to be
valid until the corresponding call to `iput()`; the inode won't be
deleted, and the memory referred to by the pointer won't be re-used for
a different inode. `iget()` provides non-exclusive access to an inode,
so that there can be many pointers to the same inode. Many parts of the
file-system code depend on this behavior of `iget()`, both to hold
long-term references to inodes (as open files and current directories)
and to prevent races while avoiding deadlock in code that manipulates
multiple inodes (such as pathname lookup).

The `struct` `inode` that `iget` returns may not have any useful
content. In order to ensure it holds a copy of the on-disk inode, code
must call `ilock`. This locks the inode (so that no other process can
`ilock` it) and reads the inode from the disk, if it has not already
been read. `iunlock` releases the lock on the inode. Separating
acquisition of inode pointers from locking helps avoid deadlock in some
situations, for example during directory lookup. Multiple processes can
hold a C pointer to an inode returned by `iget`, but only one process
can lock the inode at a time.

The inode table only stores inodes to which kernel code or data
structures hold C pointers. Its main job is synchronizing access by
multiple processes. The inode table also happens to cache
frequently-used inodes, but caching is secondary; if an inode is used
frequently, the buffer cache will probably keep it in memory. Code that
modifies an in-memory inode writes it to disk with `iupdate`.

Code: Inodes
------------

To allocate a new inode (for example, when creating a file), xv6 calls
`ialloc`
[([5059]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L200).
`ialloc` is similar to `balloc`: it loops over the inode structures on
the disk, one block at a time, looking for one that is marked free. When
it finds one, it claims it by writing the new `type` to the disk and
then returns an entry from the inode table with the tail call to `iget`
[([5073]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L214). The
correct operation of `ialloc` depends on the fact that only one process
at a time can be holding a reference to `bp`: `ialloc` can be sure that
some other process does not simultaneously see that the inode is
available and try to claim it.

`iget` [([5107]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L248)
looks through the inode table for an active entry (`ip->ref` `>` `0`)
with the desired device and inode number. If it finds one, it returns a
new reference to that inode
[[(5116-5120)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L257-L261).
As `iget` scans, it records the position of the first empty slot
[[(5121-5122)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L262-L263),
which it uses if it needs to allocate a table entry.

Code must lock the inode using `ilock` before reading or writing its
metadata or content. `ilock`
[([5153]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L294) uses a
sleep-lock for this purpose. Once `ilock` has exclusive access to the
inode, it reads the inode from disk (more likely, the buffer cache) if
needed. The function `iunlock`
[([5181]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L322)
releases the sleep-lock, which may cause any processes sleeping to be
woken up.

`iput` [([5208]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L338)
releases a C pointer to an inode by decrementing the reference count
[([5231]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L361). If
this is the last reference, the inode's slot in the inode table is now
free and can be re-used for a different inode.

If `iput` sees that there are no C pointer references to an inode and
that the inode has no links to it (occurs in no directory), then the
inode and its data blocks must be freed. `iput` calls `itrunc` to
truncate the file to zero bytes, freeing the data blocks; sets the inode
type to 0 (unallocated); and writes the inode to disk
[([5213]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L343).

The locking protocol in `iput` in the case in which it frees the inode
deserves a closer look. One danger is that a concurrent thread might be
waiting in `ilock` to use this inode (e.g., to read a file or list a
directory), and won't be prepared to find that the inode is no longer
allocated. This can't happen because there is no way for a system call
to get a pointer to an in-memory inode if it has no links to it and
`ip->ref` is one. That one reference is the reference owned by the
thread calling `iput`. The other main danger is that a concurrent call
to `ialloc` might choose the same inode that `iput` is freeing. This can
happen only after the `iupdate` writes the disk so that the inode has
type zero. This race is benign; the allocating thread will politely wait
to acquire the inode's sleep-lock before reading or writing the inode,
at which point `iput` is done with it.

`iput()` can write to the disk. This means that any system call that
uses the file system may write to the disk, because the system call may
be the last one having a reference to the file. Even calls like `read()`
that appear to be read-only, may end up calling `iput().` This, in turn,
means that even read-only system calls must be wrapped in transactions
if they use the file system.

There is a challenging interaction between `iput()` and crashes.
`iput()` doesn't truncate a file immediately when the link count for the
file drops to zero, because some process might still hold a reference to
the inode in memory: a process might still be reading and writing to the
file, because it successfully opened it. But, if a crash happens before
the last process closes the file descriptor for the file, then the file
will be marked allocated on disk but no directory entry will point to
it.

File systems handle this case in one of two ways. The simple solution is
that on recovery, after reboot, the file system scans the whole file
system for files that are marked allocated, but have no directory entry
pointing to them. If any such file exists, then it can free those files.

The second solution doesn't require scanning the file system. In this
solution, the file system records on disk (e.g., in the super block) the
inode inumber of a file whose link count drops to zero but whose
reference count isn't zero. If the file system removes the file when its
reference count reaches 0, then it updates the on-disk list by removing
that inode from the list. On recovery, the file system frees any file in
the list.

Xv6 implements neither solution, which means that inodes may be marked
allocated on disk, even though they are not in use anymore. This means
that over time xv6 runs the risk that it may run out of disk space.

Code: Inode content
-------------------

![The representation of a file on disk.](fig/inode.pdf){#fig:inode}

The on-disk inode structure, `struct dinode`, contains a size and an
array of block numbers (see
Figure [10.3](#fig:inode){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:inode"}).
The inode data is found in the blocks listed in the `dinode` 's `addrs`
array. The first `NDIRECT` blocks of data are listed in the first
`NDIRECT` entries in the array; these blocks are called *direct blocks*.
The next `NINDIRECT` blocks of data are listed not in the inode but in a
data block called the *indirect block*. The last entry in the `addrs`
array gives the address of the indirect block. Thus the first 12 kB (
`NDIRECT` `x` `BSIZE`) bytes of a file can be loaded from blocks listed
in the inode, while the next `256` kB ( `NINDIRECT` `x` `BSIZE`) bytes
can only be loaded after consulting the indirect block. This is a good
on-disk representation but a complex one for clients. The function
`bmap` manages the representation so that higher-level routines, such as
`readi` and `writei`, which we will see shortly, do not need to manage
this complexity. `bmap` returns the disk block number of the `bn`'th
data block for the inode `ip`. If `ip` does not have such a block yet,
`bmap` allocates one.

The function `bmap`
[([5283]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L406) begins
by picking off the easy case: the first `NDIRECT` blocks are listed in
the inode itself
[[(5288-5296)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L411-L419).
The next `NINDIRECT` blocks are listed in the indirect block at
`ip->addrs[NDIRECT]`. `bmap` reads the indirect block
[([5308]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L430) and
then reads a block number from the right position within the block
[([5309]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L431). If
the block number exceeds `NDIRECT+NINDIRECT`, `bmap` panics; `writei`
contains the check that prevents this from happening
[([5415]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L536).

`bmap` allocates blocks as needed. An `ip->addrs[]` or indirect entry of
zero indicates that no block is allocated. As `bmap` encounters zeros,
it replaces them with the numbers of fresh blocks, allocated on demand
[[(5289-5290)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L412-L413)
[[(5302-5303)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L424-L425).

`itrunc` frees a file's blocks, resetting the inode's size to zero.
`itrunc`
[([5327]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L449) starts
by freeing the direct blocks
[[(5333-5338)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L455-L460),
then the ones listed in the indirect block
[[(5343-5346)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L465-L468),
and finally the indirect block itself
[[(5348-5349)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L470-L471).

`bmap` makes it easy for `readi` and `writei` to get at an inode's data.
`readi`
[([5373]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L495) starts
by making sure that the offset and count are not beyond the end of the
file. Reads that start beyond the end of the file return an error
[[(5378-5379)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L500-L501)
while reads that start at or cross the end of the file return fewer
bytes than requested
[[(5380-5381)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L502-L503).
The main loop processes each block of the file, copying data from the
buffer into `dst`
[[(5383-5395)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L505-L517).
`writei`
[([5408]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L529) is
identical to `readi`, with three exceptions: writes that start at or
cross the end of the file grow the file, up to the maximum file size
[[(5415-5416)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L536-L537);
the loop copies data into the buffers instead of out
[([5424]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L545); and
if the write has extended the file, `writei` must update its size
[[(5432-5433)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L553-L554).

The function `stati`
[([5359]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L481) copies
inode metadata into the `stat` structure, which is exposed to user
programs via the `stat` system call.

Code: directory layer
---------------------

A directory is implemented internally much like a file. Its inode has
type `T_DIR` and its data is a sequence of directory entries. Each entry
is a `struct dirent`
[([4167]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.h#L58), which
contains a name and an inode number. The name is at most `DIRSIZ` (14)
characters; if shorter, it is terminated by a NULL (0) byte. Directory
entries with inode number zero are free.

The function `dirlookup`
[([5453]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L575)
searches a directory for an entry with the given name. If it finds one,
it returns a pointer to the corresponding inode, unlocked, and sets
`*poff` to the byte offset of the entry within the directory, in case
the caller wishes to edit it. If `dirlookup` finds an entry with the
right name, it updates `*poff` and returns an unlocked inode obtained
via `iget`. `dirlookup` is the reason that `iget` returns unlocked
inodes. The caller has locked `dp`, so if the lookup was for `.`, an
alias for the current directory, attempting to lock the inode before
returning would try to re-lock `dp` and deadlock. (There are more
complicated deadlock scenarios involving multiple processes and `..`, an
alias for the parent directory; `.` is not the only problem.) The caller
can unlock `dp` and then lock `ip`, ensuring that it only holds one lock
at a time.

The function `dirlink`
[([5481]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L603) writes
a new directory entry with the given name and inode number into the
directory `dp`. If the name already exists, `dirlink` returns an error
[[(5487-5491)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L609-L613).
The main loop reads directory entries looking for an unallocated entry.
When it finds one, it stops the loop early
[[(5493-5498)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L615-L620),
with `off` set to the offset of the available entry. Otherwise, the loop
ends with `off` set to `dp->size`. Either way, `dirlink` then adds a new
entry to the directory by writing at offset `off`
[[(5502-5503)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L625-L626).

Code: Path names
----------------

Path name lookup involves a succession of calls to `dirlookup`, one for
each path component. `namei`
[([5590]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L710)
evaluates `path` and returns the corresponding `inode`. The function
`nameiparent` is a variant: it stops before the last element, returning
the inode of the parent directory and copying the final element into
`name`. Both call the generalized function `namex` to do the real work.

`namex`
[([5555]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L675) starts
by deciding where the path evaluation begins. If the path begins with a
slash, evaluation begins at the root; otherwise, the current directory
[[(5559-5562)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L679-L682).
Then it uses `skipelem` to consider each element of the path in turn
[([5564]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L684). Each
iteration of the loop must look up `name` in the current inode `ip`. The
iteration begins by locking `ip` and checking that it is a directory. If
not, the lookup fails
[[(5565-5569)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L685-L689).
(Locking `ip` is necessary not because `ip->type` can change
underfoot---it can't---but because until `ilock` runs, `ip->type` is not
guaranteed to have been loaded from disk.) If the call is `nameiparent`
and this is the last path element, the loop stops early, as per the
definition of `nameiparent`; the final path element has already been
copied into `name`, so `namex` need only return the unlocked `ip`
[[(5570-5574)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L690-L694).
Finally, the loop looks for the path element using `dirlookup` and
prepares for the next iteration by setting `ip = next`
[[(5575-5580)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L695-L700).
When the loop runs out of path elements, it returns `ip`.

The procedure `namex` may take a long time to complete: it could involve
several disk operations to read inodes and directory blocks for the
directories traversed in the pathname (if they are not in the buffer
cache). Xv6 is carefully designed so that if an invocation of `namex` by
one kernel thread is blocked on a disk I/O, another kernel thread
looking up a different pathname can proceed concurrently. `namex` locks
each directory in the path separately so that lookups in different
directories can proceed in parallel.

This concurrency introduces some challenges. For example, while one
kernel thread is looking up a pathname another kernel thread may be
changing the directory tree by unlinking a directory. A potential risk
is that a lookup may be searching a directory that has been deleted by
another kernel thread and its blocks have been re-used for another
directory or file.

Xv6 avoids such races. For example, when executing `dirlookup` in
`namex`, the lookup thread holds the lock on the directory and
`dirlookup` returns an inode that was obtained using `iget`. `iget`
increases the reference count of the inode. Only after receiving the
inode from `dirlookup` does `namex` release the lock on the directory.
Now another thread may unlink the inode from the directory but xv6 will
not delete the inode yet, because the reference count of the inode is
still larger than zero.

Another risk is deadlock. For example, `next` points to the same inode
as `ip` when looking up \".\". Locking `next` before releasing the lock
on `ip` would result in a deadlock. To avoid this deadlock, `namex`
unlocks the directory before obtaining a lock on `next`. Here again we
see why the separation between `iget` and `ilock` is important.

File descriptor layer
---------------------

A cool aspect of the Unix interface is that most resources in Unix are
represented as files, including devices such as the console, pipes, and
of course, real files. The file descriptor layer is the layer that
achieves this uniformity.

Xv6 gives each process its own table of open files, or file descriptors,
as we saw in Chapter [1](#CH:UNIX){reference-type="ref"
reference="CH:UNIX"}. Each open file is represented by a `struct file`
[([4200]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.h#L1), which
is a wrapper around either an inode or a pipe, plus an I/O offset. Each
call to `open` creates a new open file (a new `struct` `file`): if
multiple processes open the same file independently, the different
instances will have different I/O offsets. On the other hand, a single
open file (the same `struct` `file`) can appear multiple times in one
process's file table and also in the file tables of multiple processes.
This would happen if one process used `open` to open the file and then
created aliases using `dup` or shared it with a child using `fork`. A
reference count tracks the number of references to a particular open
file. A file can be open for reading or writing or both. The `readable`
and `writable` fields track this.

All the open files in the system are kept in a global file table, the
`ftable`. The file table has functions to allocate a file (`filealloc`),
create a duplicate reference (`filedup`), release a reference
(`fileclose`), and read and write data (`fileread` and `filewrite`).

The first three follow the now-familiar form. `filealloc`
[([5679]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L30) scans
the file table for an unreferenced file (`f->ref` `==` `0`) and returns
a new reference; `filedup`
[([5702]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L48)
increments the reference count; and `fileclose`
[([5714]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L60)
decrements it. When a file's reference count reaches zero, `fileclose`
releases the underlying pipe or inode, according to the type.

The functions `filestat`, `fileread`, and `filewrite` implement the
`stat`, `read`, and `write` operations on files. `filestat`
[([5753]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L88) is
only allowed on inodes and calls `stati`. `fileread` and `filewrite`
check that the operation is allowed by the open mode and then pass the
call through to either the pipe or inode implementation. If the file
represents an inode, `fileread` and `filewrite` use the I/O offset as
the offset for the operation and then advance it
[[(5787-5788)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L122-L123)
[[(5830-5831)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L162-L163).
Pipes have no concept of offset. Recall that the inode functions require
the caller to handle locking
[[(5759-5761)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L94-L96)
[[(5786-5789)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L121-L124)
[[(5829-5832)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/file.c#L161-L164).
The inode locking has the convenient side effect that the read and write
offsets are updated atomically, so that multiple writing to the same
file simultaneously cannot overwrite each other's data, though their
writes may end up interlaced.

Code: System calls
------------------

With the functions that the lower layers provide, the implementation of
most system calls is trivial (see
[([5850]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c)).
There are a few calls that deserve a closer look.

The functions `sys_link` and `sys_unlink` edit directories, creating or
removing references to inodes. They are another good example of the
power of using transactions. `sys_link`
[([6002]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L124)
begins by fetching its arguments, two strings `old` and `new`
[([6007]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L129).
Assuming `old` exists and is not a directory
[[(6011-6014)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L133-L136),
`sys_link` increments its `ip->nlink` count. Then `sys_link` calls
`nameiparent` to find the parent directory and final path element of
`new`
[([6027]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L149)
and creates a new directory entry pointing at `old` 's inode
[([6030]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L152).
The new parent directory must exist and be on the same device as the
existing inode: inode numbers only have a unique meaning on a single
disk. If an error like this occurs, `sys_link` must go back and
decrement `ip->nlink`.

Transactions simplify the implementation because it requires updating
multiple disk blocks, but we don't have to worry about the order in
which we do them. They either will all succeed or none. For example,
without transactions, updating `ip->nlink` before creating a link, would
put the file system temporarily in an unsafe state, and a crash in
between could result in havoc. With transactions we don't have to worry
about this.

`sys_link` creates a new name for an existing inode. The function
`create`
[([6124]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L246)
creates a new name for a new inode. It is a generalization of the three
file creation system calls: `open` with the `O_CREATE` flag makes a new
ordinary file, `mkdir` makes a new directory, and `mkdev` makes a new
device file. Like `sys_link`, `create` starts by calling `nameiparent`
to get the inode of the parent directory. It then calls `dirlookup` to
check whether the name already exists
[([6089]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L256).
If the name does exist, `create`'s behavior depends on which system call
it is being used for: `open` has different semantics from `mkdir` and
`mkdev`. If `create` is being used on behalf of `open` (`type` `==`
`T_FILE`) and the name that exists is itself a regular file, then `open`
treats that as a success, so `create` does too
[([6138]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L260).
Otherwise, it is an error
[[(6139-6140)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L261-L262).
If the name does not already exist, `create` now allocates a new inode
with `ialloc`
[([6143]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L265).
If the new inode is a directory, `create` initializes it with `.` and
`..` entries. Finally, now that the data is initialized properly,
`create` can link it into the parent directory
[([6158]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L278).
`create`, like `sys_link`, holds two inode locks simultaneously: `ip`
and `dp`. There is no possibility of deadlock because the inode `ip` is
freshly allocated: no other process in the system will hold `ip` 's lock
and then try to lock `dp`.

Using `create`, it is easy to implement `sys_open`, `sys_mkdir`, and
`sys_mknod`. `sys_open`
[([6185]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L305)
is the most complex, because creating a new file is only a small part of
what it can do. If `open` is passed the `O_CREATE` flag, it calls
`create`
[([6201]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L320).
Otherwise, it calls `namei`
[([6207]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L326).
`create` returns a locked inode, but `namei` does not, so `sys_open`
must lock the inode itself. This provides a convenient place to check
that directories are only opened for reading, not writing. Assuming the
inode was obtained one way or the other, `sys_open` allocates a file and
a file descriptor
[([6225]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L344)
and then fills in the file
[[(6237-6242)]{style="color: blue"}](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/sysfile.c#L356-L361).
Note that no other process can access the partially initialized file
since it is only in the current process's table.

Chapter [9](#CH:SLEEP){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:SLEEP"}
examined the implementation of pipes before we even had a file system.
The function `sys_pipe` connects that implementation to the file system
by providing a way to create a pipe pair. Its argument is a pointer to
space for two integers, where it will record the two new file
descriptors. Then it allocates the pipe and installs the file
descriptors.

Real world
----------

The buffer cache in a real-world operating system is significantly more
complex than xv6's, but it serves the same two purposes: caching and
synchronizing access to the disk. Xv6's buffer cache, like V6's, uses a
simple least recently used (LRU) eviction policy; there are many more
complex policies that can be implemented, each good for some workloads
and not as good for others. A more efficient LRU cache would eliminate
the linked list, instead using a hash table for lookups and a heap for
LRU evictions. Modern buffer caches are typically integrated with the
virtual memory system to support memory-mapped files.

Xv6's logging system is inefficient. A commit cannot occur concurrently
with file-system system calls. The system logs entire blocks, even if
only a few bytes in a block are changed. It performs synchronous log
writes, a block at a time, each of which is likely to require an entire
disk rotation time. Real logging systems address all of these problems.

Logging is not the only way to provide crash recovery. Early file
systems used a scavenger during reboot (for example, the UNIX `fsck`
program) to examine every file and directory and the block and inode
free lists, looking for and resolving inconsistencies. Scavenging can
take hours for large file systems, and there are situations where it is
not possible to resolve inconsistencies in a way that causes the
original system calls to be atomic. Recovery from a log is much faster
and causes system calls to be atomic in the face of crashes.

Xv6 uses the same basic on-disk layout of inodes and directories as
early UNIX; this scheme has been remarkably persistent over the years.
BSD's UFS/FFS and Linux's ext2/ext3 use essentially the same data
structures. The most inefficient part of the file system layout is the
directory, which requires a linear scan over all the disk blocks during
each lookup. This is reasonable when directories are only a few disk
blocks, but is expensive for directories holding many files. Microsoft
Windows's NTFS, macOS's HFS, and Solaris's ZFS, just to name a few,
implement a directory as an on-disk balanced tree of blocks. This is
complicated but guarantees logarithmic-time directory lookups.

Xv6 is naive about disk failures: if a disk operation fails, xv6 panics.
Whether this is reasonable depends on the hardware: if an operating
systems sits atop special hardware that uses redundancy to mask disk
failures, perhaps the operating system sees failures so infrequently
that panicking is okay. On the other hand, operating systems using plain
disks should expect failures and handle them more gracefully, so that
the loss of a block in one file doesn't affect the use of the rest of
the file system.

Xv6 requires that the file system fit on one disk device and not change
in size. As large databases and multimedia files drive storage
requirements ever higher, operating systems are developing ways to
eliminate the "one disk per file system" bottleneck. The basic approach
is to combine many disks into a single logical disk. Hardware solutions
such as RAID are still the most popular, but the current trend is moving
toward implementing as much of this logic in software as possible. These
software implementations typically allow rich functionality like growing
or shrinking the logical device by adding or removing disks on the fly.
Of course, a storage layer that can grow or shrink on the fly requires a
file system that can do the same: the fixed-size array of inode blocks
used by xv6 would not work well in such environments. Separating disk
management from the file system may be the cleanest design, but the
complex interface between the two has led some systems, like Sun's ZFS,
to combine them.

Xv6's file system lacks many other features of modern file systems; for
example, it lacks support for snapshots and incremental backup.

Modern Unix systems allow many kinds of resources to be accessed with
the same system calls as on-disk storage: named pipes, network
connections, remotely-accessed network file systems, and monitoring and
control interfaces such as `/proc`. Instead of xv6's `if` statements in
`fileread` and `filewrite`, these systems typically give each open file
a table of function pointers, one per operation, and call the function
pointer to invoke that inode's implementation of the call. Network file
systems and user-level file systems provide functions that turn those
calls into network RPCs and wait for the response before returning.

Exercises
---------

1.  Why panic in `balloc` ? Can xv6 recover?

2.  Why panic in `ialloc` ? Can xv6 recover?

3.  Why doesn't `filealloc` panic when it runs out of files? Why is this
    more common and therefore worth handling?

4.  Suppose the file corresponding to `ip` gets unlinked by another
    process between `sys_link` 's calls to `iunlock(ip)` and `dirlink`.
    Will the link be created correctly? Why or why not?

5.  `create` makes four function calls (one to `ialloc` and three to
    `dirlink`) that it requires to succeed. If any doesn't, `create`
    calls `panic`. Why is this acceptable? Why can't any of those four
    calls fail?

6.  `sys_chdir` calls `iunlock(ip)` before `iput(cp->cwd)`, which might
    try to lock `cp->cwd`, yet postponing `iunlock(ip)` until after the
    `iput` would not cause deadlocks. Why not?

7.  Implement the `lseek` system call. Supporting `lseek` will also
    require that you modify `filewrite` to fill holes in the file with
    zero if `lseek` sets `off` beyond `f->ip->size.`

8.  Add `O_TRUNC` and `O_APPEND` to `open`, so that `>` and `>>`
    operators work in the shell.

9.  Modify the file system to support symbolic links.

10. Modify the file system to support named pipes.

11. Modify the file and VM system to support memory-mapped files.

Concurrency revisited {#CH:LOCK2}
=====================

Simultaneously obtaining good parallel performance, correctness despite
concurrency, and understandable code is a big challenge in kernel
design. Straightforward use of locks is the best path to correctness,
but is not always possible. This chapter highlights examples in which
xv6 is forced to use locks in an involved way, and examples where xv6
uses lock-like techniques but not locks.

Locking patterns
----------------

Cached items are often a challenge to lock. For example, the file
system's block cache
[([4275]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L26) stores
copies of up to `NBUF` disk blocks. It's vital that a given disk block
have at most one copy in the cache; otherwise, different processes might
make conflicting changes to different copies of what ought to be the
same block. Each cached block is stored in a `struct buf`
[([3900]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/buf.h). A
`struct buf` has a lock field which helps ensure that only one process
uses a given disk block at a time. However, that lock is not enough:
what if a block is not present in the cache at all, and two processes
want to use it at the same time? There is no `struct buf` (since the
block isn't yet cached), and thus there is nothing to lock. Xv6 deals
with this situation by associating an additional lock (`bcache.lock`)
with the set of identities of cached blocks. Code that needs to check if
a block is cached (e.g., `bget`
[([4308]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/bio.c#L59)), or
change the set of cached blocks, must hold `bcache.lock`; after that
code has found the block and `struct buf` it needs, it can release
` bcache.lock` and lock just the specific block. This is a common
pattern: one lock for the set of items, plus one lock per item.

Ordinarily the same function that acquires a lock will release it. But a
more precise way to view things is that a lock is acquired at the start
of a sequence that must appear atomic, and released when that sequence
ends. If the sequence starts and ends in different functions, or
different threads, or on different CPUs, then the lock acquire and
release must do the same. The function of the lock is to force other
uses to wait, not to pin a piece of data to a particular agent. One
example is the `acquire` in `yield`
[([2629]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L494),
which is released in the scheduler thread rather than in the acquiring
process. Another example is the `acquiresleep` in `ilock`
[([5153]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L294); this
code often sleeps while reading the disk; it may wake up on a different
CPU, which means the lock may be acquired and released on different
CPUs.

Freeing an object that is protected by a lock embedded in the object is
a delicate business, since owning the lock is not enough to guarantee
that freeing would be correct. The problem case arises when some other
thread is waiting in `acquire` to use the object; freeing the object
implicitly frees the embedded lock, which will cause the waiting thread
to malfunction. One solution is to track how many references to the
object exist, so that it is only freed when the last reference
disappears. See `pipeclose`
[([6661]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L59) for
an example; `pi->readopen` and `pi->writeopen` track whether the pipe
has file descriptors referring to it.

Usually one sees locks around sequences of reads and writes to sets of
related items; the locks ensure that other threads see only completed
sequences of updates (as long as they, too, lock). What about situations
where the update is a simple write to a single shared variable? For
example, `setkilled` and `killed`
[([2775]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L614) lock
around their simple uses of `p->killed`. If there were no lock, one
thread could write `p->killed` at the same time that another thread
reads it. This is a race, and the C language specification says that a
race yields *undefined behavior*, which means the program may crash or
yield incorrect results[^4]. The locks prevent the race and avoid the
undefined behavior.

One reason races can break programs is that, if there are no locks or
equivalent constructs, the compiler may generate machine code that reads
and writes memory in ways quite different than the original C code. For
example, the machine code of a thread calling `killed` could copy
`p->killed` to a register and read only that cached value; this would
mean that the thread might never see any writes to `p->killed`. The
locks prevent such caching.

Lock-like patterns
------------------

In many places xv6 uses a reference count or a flag in a lock-like way
to indicate that an object is allocated and should not be freed or
re-used. A process's `p->state` acts in this way, as do the reference
counts in `file`, `inode`, and `buf` structures. While in each case a
lock protects the flag or reference count, it is the latter that
prevents the object from being prematurely freed.

The file system uses `struct inode` reference counts as a kind of shared
lock that can be held by multiple processes, in order to avoid deadlocks
that would occur if the code used ordinary locks. For example, the loop
in `namex`
[([5555]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/fs.c#L675) locks
the directory named by each pathname component in turn. However, `namex`
must release each lock at the end of the loop, since if it held multiple
locks it could deadlock with itself if the pathname included a dot
(e.g., `a/./b`). It might also deadlock with a concurrent lookup
involving the directory and `..`. As
Chapter [10](#CH:FS){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:FS"} explains,
the solution is for the loop to carry the directory inode over to the
next iteration with its reference count incremented, but not locked.

Some data items are protected by different mechanisms at different
times, and may at times be protected from concurrent access implicitly
by the structure of the xv6 code rather than by explicit locks. For
example, when a physical page is free, it is protected by `kmem.lock`
[([2973]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/kalloc.c#L24). If
the page is then allocated as a pipe
[([6622]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/pipe.c#L23), it
is protected by a different lock (the embedded `pi->lock`). If the page
is re-allocated for a new process's user memory, it is not protected by
a lock at all. Instead, the fact that the allocator won't give that page
to any other process (until it is freed) protects it from concurrent
access. The ownership of a new process's memory is complex: first the
parent allocates and manipulates it in `fork`, then the child uses it,
and (after the child exits) the parent again owns the memory and passes
it to ` kfree`. There are two lessons here: a data object may be
protected from concurrency in different ways at different points in its
lifetime, and the protection may take the form of implicit structure
rather than explicit locks.

A final lock-like example is the need to disable interrupts around calls
to `mycpu()`
[([2187]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/proc.c#L83).
Disabling interrupts causes the calling code to be atomic with respect
to timer interrupts that could force a context switch, and thus move the
process to a different CPU.

No locks at all
---------------

There are a few places where xv6 shares mutable data with no locks at
all. One is in the implementation of spinlocks, although one could view
the RISC-V atomic instructions as relying on locks implemented in
hardware. Another is the `started` variable in `main.c`
[([1156]{style="color: blue"})](./xv6-riscv-src/kernel/main.c#L7), used
to prevent other CPUs from running until CPU zero has finished
initializing xv6; the `volatile` ensures that the compiler actually
generates load and store instructions.

Xv6 contains cases in which one CPU or thread writes some data, and
another CPU or thread reads the data, but there is no specific lock
dedicated to protecting that data. For example, in `fork`, the parent
writes the child's user memory pages, and the child (a different thread,
perhaps on a different CPU) reads those pages; no lock explicitly
protects those pages. This is not strictly a locking problem, since the
child doesn't start executing until after the parent has finished
writing. It is a potential memory ordering problem (see
Chapter [7](#CH:LOCK){reference-type="ref" reference="CH:LOCK"}), since
without a memory barrier there's no reason to expect one CPU to see
another CPU's writes. However, since the parent releases locks, and the
child acquires locks as it starts up, the memory barriers in `acquire`
and `release` ensure that the child's CPU sees the parent's writes.

Parallelism
-----------

Locking is primarily about suppressing parallelism in the interests of
correctness. Because performance is also important, kernel designers
often have to think about how to use locks in a way that both achieves
correctness and allows parallelism. While xv6 is not systematically
designed for high performance, it's still worth considering which xv6
operations can execute in parallel, and which might conflict on locks.

Pipes in xv6 are an example of fairly good parallelism. Each pipe has
its own lock, so that different processes can read and write different
pipes in parallel on different CPUs. For a given pipe, however, the
writer and reader must wait for each other to release the lock; they
can't read/write the same pipe at the same time. It is also the case
that a read from an empty pipe (or a write to a full pipe) must block,
but this is not due to the locking scheme.

Context switching is a more complex example. Two kernel threads, each
executing on its own CPU, can call `yield`, `sched`, and ` swtch` at the
same time, and the calls will execute in parallel. The threads each hold
a lock, but they are different locks, so they don't have to wait for
each other. Once in `scheduler`, however, the two CPUs may conflict on
locks while searching the table of processes for one that is `RUNNABLE`.
That is, xv6 is likely to get a performance benefit from multiple CPUs
during context switch, but perhaps not as much as it could.

Another example is concurrent calls to `fork` from different processes
on different CPUs. The calls may have to wait for each other for
`pid_lock` and `kmem.lock`, and for per-process locks needed to search
the process table for an `UNUSED` process. On the other hand, the two
forking processes can copy user memory pages and format page-table pages
fully in parallel.

The locking scheme in each of the above examples sacrifices parallel
performance in certain cases. In each case it's possible to obtain more
parallelism using a more elaborate design. Whether it's worthwhile
depends on details: how often the relevant operations are invoked, how
long the code spends with a contended lock held, how many CPUs might be
running conflicting operations at the same time, whether other parts of
the code are more restrictive bottlenecks. It can be difficult to guess
whether a given locking scheme might cause performance problems, or
whether a new design is significantly better, so measurement on
realistic workloads is often required.

Exercises
---------

1.  Modify xv6's pipe implementation to allow a read and a write to the
    same pipe to proceed in parallel on different CPUs.

2.  Modify xv6's `scheduler()` to reduce lock contention when different
    CPUs are looking for runnable processes at the same time.

3.  Eliminate some of the serialization in xv6's `fork()`.

Summary {#CH:SUM}
=======

This text introduced the main ideas in operating systems by studying one
operating system, xv6, line by line. Some code lines embody the essence
of the main ideas (e.g., context switching, user/kernel boundary, locks,
etc.) and each line is important; other code lines provide an
illustration of how to implement a particular operating system idea and
could easily be done in different ways (e.g., a better algorithm for
scheduling, better on-disk data structures to represent files, better
logging to allow for concurrent transactions, etc.). All the ideas were
illustrated in the context of one particular, very successful system
call interface, the Unix interface, but those ideas carry over to the
design of other operating systems.

    computation with the term *CPU*, an acronym for central processing
    unit. Other documentation (e.g., the RISC-V specification) also uses

    to a computer with several distinct processor chips.
